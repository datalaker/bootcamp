Linear Regression is not only used in the field of machine learning and data science but also in epidemiology, finance, economics, and so on. Practically any situation where a relationship between continuous variables is presented, Linear Regression can model such relation in one way or another. To generalize, the application of Linear Regression falls under the use of predicting or forecasting certain response variables based on related explanatory features; Linear Regression can also be used to quantify or measure the linear relation between two variables and to identify possible redundant or misleading features in a dataset."),(0,a.kt)("p",null,"Linear Regression models the relationship between one response, or target variable, and one or more features, or explanatory variables that may be correlated to the target variable in a linear fashion. Linear Regression with two variables, with one feature describing the target, is called Simple Linear Regression. On the other hand, Linear Regression that models multiple feature variables against one target variable is referred to as Multiple Linear Regression. The goal of Linear Regression is to find a function that produces a \u201cline of best fit\u201d that best models the relationship between the features and the target variables.
