The piccolo-relational features only highlight descriptive statistics, plotting of data, formulation of linear and nonlinear models, and solving the roots of the models. The transactions in this project utilize mainly the NumPy, pandas, scipy, and matplotlib modules. On the other hand, the piccolo-mongo focuses on workflow using Celery and Redis, GraphQL with graphene 3, and Ne04J operations.

It even classifies the recipes according to the place of origin and menu type. Users may search for their desired recipe for reference, rating, and feedback purposes. It has a feature that allows users to attach keywords to each recipe for search purposes. The microservice application is an initial architecture for a robust online recipe platform. This application uses the FastAPI framework driven by Python 3.8. No database included yet. The requirements.txt will guide you with the dependencies. Just install by running: pip install -r requirements.txt ## Details It is feasible to use a repository-service pattern in some complex FastAPI applications through DI. The repository-service pattern is responsible for the creation of the repository layer of the application, which manages the Creation, Reading, Updates, and Deletion (CRUD) of data source. A repository layer requires data models that depict the table schemas of a collection or database. The repository layer needs the service layer to establish a connection with other parts of the application. The service layer operates like a business layer, where the data sources and business processes meet to derive all the necessary objects needed by the REST API. The communication between the repository and service layers can only be possible by creating injectables."),(0,i.kt)("li",{parentName:"ol"},"Online Restaurant Review System API - This prototype is a feedback and rating system designed for various restaurants.
