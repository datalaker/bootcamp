In 1977, various professors from Berkley and Stanford developed an algorithm known as Classification and Regression Trees (CART), which, true to its name, consisted of Classification and Regression Trees.

Quickly, the idea of Gradient Boosting Machines became extremely popular and proved to be high performing in many real-life tabular datasets.

Although the paper wasn\u2019t ever published due to the confidential nature of the work, it laid out the groundwork for the first-ever nonparametric classification method, K-Nearest Neighbors. The beauty of KNN lies in its simplicity, and unlike most other algorithms, KNN does not contain a training phase.

There are two main reasons to perform feature selection: removing redundant (very similar information content) features and filtering out irrelevant (information content not valuable w.r.t. the target) features that may worsen model performance. The difference between feature extraction and feature selection lies in that selection reduces the number of features while extraction creates new features or modifies existing ones. A universal approach to feature selection usually consists of obtaining a measure of \u201cusefulness\u201d for each feature and then eliminating those that do not meet a threshold. Note that no matter which method for feature selection is used, the best result will likely come from trial and error since the optimal techniques and tools vary for datasets.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"datascience/metrics-and-evaluation":{"id":"datascience/metrics-and-evaluation","title":"Metrics and Evaluation","description":"In general terms, metrics are tools to set standards and evaluate the performance of models.

ORC was very popular for use with Apache Hive; while still widely used, we generally see it much less than Apache Parquet, and it enjoys somewhat less support in modern cloud ecosystem tools.

Parquet solves a few problems that frequently bedevil data engineers. Parquet-encoded data builds in schema information and natively supports nested data, unlike CSV. Furthermore, Parquet is portable; while databases such as BigQuery and Snowflake serialize data in proprietary columnar formats and offer excellent query performance on data stored internally, a huge performance hit occurs when interoperating with external tools. Data must be deserialized, reserialized into an exchangeable format, and exported to use data lake tools such as Spark and Presto. Parquet files in a data lake may be a superior option to proprietary cloud data warehouses in a polyglot tool environment.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"storage/parquet-vs-csv":{"id":"storage/parquet-vs-csv","title":"Parquet vs CSV","description":"While CSV is simple and the most widely used data format (Excel, Google Sheets), there are several distinct advantages for Parquet, including:","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"storage/postgres":{"id":"storage/postgres","title":"Postgres","description":"Picking the right database management system is a difficult task due to the vast number of options on the market. Depending on the business model, you can pick a commercial database or an open source database with commercial support.

When it comes to picking a relational database management system, PostgreSQL stands at the top for several reasons.

While the abundance of options is a significant source of pain in data engineering, they are also a massive opportunity for performance improvements. We\u2019ve sometimes seen job performance improve by a factor of 100 simply by switching from CSV to Parquet serialization. As data moves through a pipeline, engineers will also manage reserialization\u2014conversion from one format to another. Sometimes data engineers have no choice but to accept data in an ancient, nasty form; they must design processes to deserialize this format and handle exceptions, and then clean up and convert data for consistent, fast downstream processing and consumption.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"storage/snowflake":{"id":"storage/snowflake","title":"Snowflake","description":"Snowflake is the Data Cloud that enables you to build data-intensive applications without operational burden, so you can focus on data and analytics instead of infrastructure management.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"storage/sqlite":{"id":"storage/sqlite","title":"SQLite","description":"SQLite is a C-language library that implements a small, fast, self-contained, high-reliability, full-featured, SQL database engine.
