In the cloud, every major cloud provider leverages and promotes a data lake, e.g. AWS S3, Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS), Google Cloud Storage (GCS). As a result, the vast majority of the data of most organizations is stored in cloud data lakes. Over time, most organizations store their data in an open standardized format, typically either Apache Parquet format or ORC format. As a result, a large ecosystem of tools and applications can directly work with these open data formats. This approach of storing data in open formats, at a very low cost has enabled organizations to amass large quantities of data in data lakes while avoiding vendor lock-in. At the same time, data lakes have suffered from three main problems - security, quality, and performance despite these advantages. Since all the data is stored and managed as files, it does not provide fine-grained access control on the contents of files, but only coarse-grained access governing who can access what files or directories. The query performance is poor because the formats are not optimized for fast access, and listing files is computationally expensive. In short, organizations end up moving data into other systems to make use of the data, unless the applications can tolerate noise (i.e. machine learning). Finally, quality is a challenge because it\u2019s hard to prevent data corruption and manage schema changes as more and more data gets ingested to the data lake.
