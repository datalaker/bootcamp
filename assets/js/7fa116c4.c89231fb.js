Overall, effective experiment tracking will save us operational costs and allows us to derive the right conclusion from a minimal set of experimental results. One of the basic approaches for effective experiment tracking is adding a unique identifier to each experiment. The information we need to track for each experiment includes project dependencies, the definition of the model architecture, parameters used, and evaluation metrics. Experiment tracking also includes visualizing ongoing experiments in real time and being able to compare a set of experiments intuitively. For example, if we can check train and validation losses from every epoch as the model gets trained, we can identify overfitting quicker, saving some resources. Also, by comparing results and a set of changes made between two experiments, we can understand how the changes affect the model performance."),(0,r.kt)("h2",{id:"model-management"},(0,r.kt)("strong",{parentName:"h2"},"Model management")),(0,r.kt)("p",null,"Model management goes beyond\xa0experiment tracking as it\xa0covers the full life cycle of a model: dataset information, artifacts (any data generated from training a model), the implementation of the model, evaluation metrics, and pipeline information (such as development, testing, staging, and production).
