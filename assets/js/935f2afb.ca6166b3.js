Time travel is possible because dimension tables contain the exact version of the associated attributes at different time ranges.

It was around that time when people discovered the usefulness of Decision Trees in programming and mathematics. The first paper that was able to develop a concept of \u201cDecision Tree\u201d mathematically was published by William Belson in 1959. In 1977, various professors from Berkley and Stanford developed an algorithm known as Classification and Regression Trees (CART), which, true to its name, consisted of Classification and Regression Trees. To this day, CART still stands as an important algorithm for data analysis. In the field of ML, Decision Tree serves as one of the most popular algorithms for real-world data science problems.","sidebar":"docs"},"datascience/algorithms/gradient-boosting":{"id":"datascience/algorithms/gradient-boosting","title":"Gradient Boosting","description":"Gradient Boosting describes a certain technique in modeling with a variety of different algorithms that are based upon it. The first successful algorithm that utilizes Gradient Boosting is AdaBoost (Adaptive Gradient Boosting) in 1998 formulated by Leo Breiman. In 1999, Jerome Friedman composed the generalization of boosting algorithms emerging at this time, such as AdaBoost, into a single method: Gradient Boosting Machines. Quickly, the idea of Gradient Boosting Machines became extremely popular and proved to be high performing in many real-life tabular datasets. To this day, various Gradient Boosting algorithms such as AdaBoost, XGBoost, and LightGBM are the first choice for many data scientists operating on large, difficult datasets.","sidebar":"docs"},"datascience/algorithms/knn":{"id":"datascience/algorithms/knn","title":"K-Nearest Neighbors","description":"K-Nearest Neighbors, or KNN, is one of the simplest and the most intuitive classical machine learning algorithms. KNN was first proposed by Evelyn Fix and Joseph Lawson Hodges Jr. during a technical analysis produced for USAF in 1951. It was unique at its time as the method proposed is nonparametric: the algorithm does not make any assumptions about the statistical properties of the data. Although the paper wasn\u2019t ever published due to the confidential nature of the work, it laid out the groundwork for the first-ever nonparametric classification method, K-Nearest Neighbors. The beauty of KNN lies in its simplicity, and unlike most other algorithms, KNN does not contain a training phase. Additional data can be incorporated seamlessly as the algorithm is memory-based, easily adapting to any new data. Over seven decades later, KNN still stands as a popular classification algorithm, and innovations are still constantly being proposed surrounding it.","sidebar":"docs"},"datascience/algorithms/linear-regression":{"id":"datascience/algorithms/linear-regression","title":"Linear Regression","description":"The earliest form of regression analysis, Linear Regression using Least Squares, was first published by Adrien-Marie Legendre in 1805 and then again by Carl Friedrich Gauss in 1809.

Later in 1821, Gauss published his continued work on the Least Square Theory; however, the term regression wasn\u2019t coined until the late nineteenth century by Francis Galton. Galton discovered a linear relationship between the weights of mother and daughter seeds across generations. To Galton, regression was merely a term to describe a biological phenomenon.

However, the first practical application of such a function wasn\u2019t apparent until 1943 when Wilson and Worcester used the logistic function in bioassay. In the following years, various advances were made toward the function, but the original logistic function is used for Logistic Regression.

The technique that Random Forest uses to ensemble smaller Decision Trees is called bagging.

A universal approach to feature selection usually consists of obtaining a measure of \u201cusefulness\u201d for each feature and then eliminating those that do not meet a threshold.

Parquet solves a few problems that frequently bedevil data engineers. Parquet-encoded data builds in schema information and natively supports nested data, unlike CSV. Furthermore, Parquet is portable; while databases such as BigQuery and Snowflake serialize data in proprietary columnar formats and offer excellent query performance on data stored internally, a huge performance hit occurs when interoperating with external tools. Data must be deserialized, reserialized into an exchangeable format, and exported to use data lake tools such as Spark and Presto. Parquet files in a data lake may be a superior option to proprietary cloud data warehouses in a polyglot tool environment.","sidebar":"docs"},"storage/parquet-vs-csv":{"id":"storage/parquet-vs-csv","title":"Parquet vs CSV","description":"While CSV is simple and the most widely used data format (Excel, Google Sheets), there are several distinct advantages for Parquet, including:","sidebar":"docs"},"storage/postgres":{"id":"storage/postgres","title":"Postgres","description":"Picking the right database management system is a difficult task due to the vast number of options on the market. Depending on the business model, you can pick a commercial database or an open source database with commercial support.

When it comes to picking a relational database management system, PostgreSQL stands at the top for several reasons.

While the abundance of options is a significant source of pain in data engineering, they are also a massive opportunity for performance improvements. We\u2019ve sometimes seen job performance improve by a factor of 100 simply by switching from CSV to Parquet serialization. As data moves through a pipeline, engineers will also manage reserialization\u2014conversion from one format to another. Sometimes data engineers have no choice but to accept data in an ancient, nasty form; they must design processes to deserialize this format and handle exceptions, and then clean up and convert data for consistent, fast downstream processing and consumption.","sidebar":"docs"},"storage/snowflake":{"id":"storage/snowflake","title":"Snowflake","description":"Snowflake is the Data Cloud that enables you to build data-intensive applications without operational burden, so you can focus on data and analytics instead of infrastructure management.","sidebar":"docs"},"storage/sqlite":{"id":"storage/sqlite","title":"SQLite","description":"SQLite is a C-language library that implements a small, fast, self-contained, high-reliability, full-featured, SQL database engine.
