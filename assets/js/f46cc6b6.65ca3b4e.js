The Spark jobs crunch the data from this sales database with other data to produce the datasets that power the sales dashboard. This understanding helps the data team set goals for their copy job and Spark job appropriately. The Spark job needs to be completed by 8 A.M. to give a one-hour buffer for any unforeseen issues.
