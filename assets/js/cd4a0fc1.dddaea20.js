Just install by running: pip install -r requirements.txt ## Details It is feasible to use a repository-service pattern in some complex FastAPI applications through DI. The repository-service pattern is responsible for the creation of the repository layer of the application, which manages the Creation, Reading, Updates, and Deletion (CRUD) of data source. A repository layer requires data models that depict the table schemas of a collection or database. The repository layer needs the service layer to establish a connection with other parts of the application. The service layer operates like a business layer, where the data sources and business processes meet to derive all the necessary objects needed by the REST API.
