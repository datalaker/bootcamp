Cloud data lake architectures are designed to solve these exact problems, since they were designed to meet the needs of explosive growth of data and their sources, without making any assumptions on the source, the formats, the size, or the quality of the data. In contrast to the problem-first approach taken by traditional data warehouses, cloud data lakes take a data-first approach. In a cloud data lake architecture, all data is considered to be useful - either immediately or to meet a future need. And the first step in a cloud data architecture involves ingesting data in their raw, natural state, without any restrictions on the source, the size, or the format of the data. This data is stored in a cloud data lake, a storage system that is highly scalable and can store any kind of data.
