For HPC applications, data durability is of the utmost importance. For example, for training an ML model, data scientists need to carry out various experiments on the same dataset in order to fine-tune the model parameters to get the best performance. If the data storage from which training and validation data is read is not durable for these experiments, then the results of the trained model will not be consistent and hence can lead to incorrect insights, as well as bad inference results.
