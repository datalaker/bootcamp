Indeed, BigQuery has a native, highly efficient columnar storage format9 that makes ETL an attractive methodology. The data pipeline, typically written in either Apache Beam or Apache Spark, extracts the necessary bits from the raw data (either streaming data or batch files), transforms what it has extracted to do any necessary cleanup or aggregation, and then loads it into BigQuery.
