A transactional database is commonly known as online transaction processing (OLTP) considering that this type of database serves online transactional operations between the application and the database. For an organization, transactional databases usually have their data segmented into entities, which can be tables (or not), with or without a relationship between these entities to facilitate the correlation between this data. For example, an e-commerce database can be structured with a table called Shopping_Cart, which represents the products that are being selected in the store during user navigation, and another called Purchases with the completed transaction records.
