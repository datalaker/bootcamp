# Probability Distributions

Random variables are important in analysis. Probability distributions depict the distribution of the values of a random variable. The distributions can help in selecting the right algorithms, and hence plotting the distribution of the data is an important part of the analytical process; this is performed as a part of exploratory data analysis (EDA). The following are some important probability distributions:

- Normal distribution
- Binomial distribution
- Poisson distribution
- Uniform distribution
- Chi-squared distribution
- Exponential distribution
