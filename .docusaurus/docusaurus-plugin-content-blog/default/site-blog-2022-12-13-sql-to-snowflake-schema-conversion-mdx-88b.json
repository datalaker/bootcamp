  "description": "Last week, I was asked to migrate one view from the On-premises MS SQL Server to Snowflake. My first approach is to directly copy paste the DDL (Data Definition Language) and as I predicted, it didn't work. But my goal here was to follow TDD (Test Driven Development) - I ran the first version of DDL and Snowflake told me what the error is, I corrected the error and repeated the cycle 6-8 times until the code ran successfully without error and that's how I did the migration.",
