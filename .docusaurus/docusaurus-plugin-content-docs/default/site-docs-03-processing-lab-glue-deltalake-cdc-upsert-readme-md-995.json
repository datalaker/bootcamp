  "description": "Many customers need an ACID transaction (atomic, consistent, isolated, durable) data lake that can log change data capture (CDC) from operational data sources. There is also demand for merging real-time data into batch data. Delta Lake framework provides these two capabilities. In this lab, we learn how to handle UPSERTs (updates and inserts) of the operational data using natively integrated Delta Lake with AWS Glue, and query the Delta Lake using Amazon Athena.",
