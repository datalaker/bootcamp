  "description": "A partition in spark is a logical chunk of data mapped to a single node in a cluster. Partitions are basic units of parallelism. Each partition is processed by a single task slot. In a multicore system, total slots for tasks will be num of executors x number of cores. Hence the number of partitions decides the task parallelism.",
