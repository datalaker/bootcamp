  "description": "This challenge will focus on your ability to write a small application that can read from an AWS SQS Qeueue, transform that data, then write to a Postgres database. Your objective is to read JSON data containing user login behavior from an AWS SQS Queue. Fetch wants to hide personal identifiable information (PII). The fields device_id and ip should be masked, but in a way where it is easy for data analysts to identify duplicate values in those fields. Once you have flattened the JSON data object and masked those two fields, write each record to a Postgres database.",
