  "description": "To round out the discussion of serialization, we briefly discuss database storage engines. All databases have an underlying storage engine; many donâ€™t expose their storage engines as a separate abstraction (for example, BigQuery, Snowflake). Some (notably, MySQL) support fully pluggable storage engines. Others (e.g., SQL Server) offer major storage engine configuration options (columnar versus row-based storage) that dramatically affect database behavior.",
