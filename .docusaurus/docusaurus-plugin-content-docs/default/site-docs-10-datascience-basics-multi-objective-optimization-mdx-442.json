  "description": "Recommender systems have been widely applied to several domains and applications. Traditional recommender systems usually deal with a single objective, such as minimizing the prediction errors or maximizing the ranking of the recommendation list. There is an emerging demand for multi-objective optimization so that the development of recommendation models can take multiple objectives into consideration, especially in the area of multi-stakeholder and multi-task recommender systems.",
