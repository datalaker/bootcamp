  "description": "Do your product dashboards look funky? Are your quarterly reports stale? Is the data set you're using broken or just plain wrong? Have you ever been about to sign off after a long day running queries or building data pipelines only to get pinged by your head of marketing that “the data is missing” from a critical report? What about a frantic email from your CTO about “duplicate data” in a business intelligence dashboard?
