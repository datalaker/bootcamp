  "description": "Many serialization algorithms and formats are available to data engineers. While the abundance of options is a significant source of pain in data engineering, they are also a massive opportunity for performance improvements. We’ve sometimes seen job performance improve by a factor of 100 simply by switching from CSV to Parquet serialization. As data moves through a pipeline, engineers will also manage reserialization—conversion from one format to another. Sometimes data engineers have no choice but to accept data in an ancient, nasty form; they must design processes to deserialize this format and handle exceptions, and then clean up and convert data for consistent, fast downstream processing and consumption.",
