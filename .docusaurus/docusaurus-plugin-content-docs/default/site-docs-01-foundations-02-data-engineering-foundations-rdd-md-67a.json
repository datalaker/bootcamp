  "description": "An RDD (Resilient Distributed Dataset) is the primary data structure in Spark. It is a distributed collection of data that can be processed in parallel. RDDs are immutable, meaning that once an RDD is created, it cannot be modified. Instead, any transformations applied to an RDD will return a new RDD.",
