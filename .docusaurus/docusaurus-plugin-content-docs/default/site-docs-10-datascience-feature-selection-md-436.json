  "description": "Feature selection refers to the process of filtering out or removing features from a dataset. There are two main reasons to perform feature selection: removing redundant (very similar information content) features and filtering out irrelevant (information content not valuable w.r.t. the target) features that may worsen model performance. The difference between feature extraction and feature selection lies in that selection reduces the number of features while extraction creates new features or modifies existing ones. A universal approach to feature selection usually consists of obtaining a measure of “usefulness” for each feature and then eliminating those that do not meet a threshold. Note that no matter which method for feature selection is used, the best result will likely come from trial and error since the optimal techniques and tools vary for datasets.",
