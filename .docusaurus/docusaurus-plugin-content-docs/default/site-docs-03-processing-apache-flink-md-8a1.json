  "description": "Apache Flink is a widely used data processing engine for scalable streaming ETL, analytics, and event-driven applications. It provides precise time and state management with fault tolerance. Flink can process bounded stream (batch) and unbounded stream (stream) with a unified API or application. After data is processed with Apache Flink, downstream applications can access the curated data with a unified data catalog. With unified metadata, both data processing and data consuming applications can access the tables using the same metadata.",
