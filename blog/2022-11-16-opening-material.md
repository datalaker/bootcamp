For short period of time, to help laid off job seekers, We have decided to open source our data engineering bootcamp material. It's the same website we use for students

Check it out here - https://datacamp.recohut.com/

:::tip
Curious how we build this docs website with minimum effort and tech behind it?

Its based on library @docusaurus which is react based static site generator 

It even has a site wide elastic search built in. 

(Try Searching it on website, I am sure you will be impressed)
