Python is a powerful object-oriented programming language used in many development areas and is considered a perfect language for scripting. Python is a cross-platform programming language that allows you to code faster with lesser code writing required.

The course begins with a complete introduction to the capabilities and features of Python and how to set up the language on your computer along with PyCharm IDE. You will learn about multiple programming-paradigms (object-oriented, functional, and imperative). You will explore the concepts of an interpreted language that is dynamically typed and cross-platform. The course advances to explain the concepts of OOP: variables, user input, statements, functions, classes, and objects. You will learn about functions, tuples, dictionaries, and lists in Python. You will also explore various operator modules including math, statistics, and random modules. You will work on practical examples to understand the concepts of Python programming well.

Upon completion, you will master advanced-level programming skillsets of Python and execute codes successfully. You will be able to complete your quest for learning to program using Python. Using the various built-in Python modules, you will grasp a must-know skill for data science and interpretation.

## What You Will Learn
