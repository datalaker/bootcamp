skill level, and how you fit into the company’s data engineering team.</p><p>Behavioral questions are expected early in the data engineering process (e.g., recruiter call) and include questions about your experience.</p><p>Examples of behavioral interview questions for a data engineer role would be:</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="describe-a-data-engineering-problem-you-have-faced-what-were-some-challenges">Describe a data engineering problem you have faced. What were some challenges?<a class="hash-link" href="#describe-a-data-engineering-problem-you-have-faced-what-were-some-challenges" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Questions like this assess many soft skills, including your ability to communicate and how you respond to adversity. Your answer should convey:</p><ul><li>The situation</li><li>Specific tactics you proposed</li><li>What actions you took</li><li>The results you achieved</li></ul><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="talk-about-a-time-you-noticed-a-discrepancy-in-company-data-or-an-inefficiency-in-the-data-processing-what-did-you-do">Talk about a time you noticed a discrepancy in company data or an inefficiency in the data processing. What did you do?<a class="hash-link" href="#talk-about-a-time-you-noticed-a-discrepancy-in-company-data-or-an-inefficiency-in-the-data-processing-what-did-you-do" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Your response might demonstrate your experience level, that you take the initiative and your problem-solving approach. This question is your chance to show the unique skills and creative solutions you bring to the table.</p><p>Don’t have this type of experience? You can relate your experiences to coursework or projects. Or you can talk hypothetically about your knowledge of data governance and how you would apply that in the role.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="in-the-interview-you-are-to-develop-a-new-product-where-would-you-begin">In the interview, you are to develop a new product. Where would you begin?<a class="hash-link" href="#in-the-interview-you-are-to-develop-a-new-product-where-would-you-begin" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Candidates should have an understanding of how data engineering plays into product development. Interviewers want to know how well you’ll fit in with the team, your organizational ability in product development, or how you might simplify an existing workflow.</p><p>One Tip: Get to know the company’s products and business model before the interview. Knowing this will help you relate your most relevant skills and experiences. Plus, it shows you did your homework and care about the position.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="tell-me-about-a-time-you-exceeded-expectations-on-a-project-what-did-you-do-and-how-did-you-accomplish-it">Tell me about a time you exceeded expectations on a project. What did you do, and how did you accomplish it?<a class="hash-link" href="#tell-me-about-a-time-you-exceeded-expectations-on-a-project-what-did-you-do-and-how-did-you-accomplish-it" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>The STAR framework is the perfect model for answering a question like this. That will cover the how and why. However, one difference with this type of question is showing the value add to your work. For data engineering positions, you might have gone above and beyond, and as a result, you were able to reduce costs, save time, or improve your team’s analytics capacity.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="describe-a-time-you-had-to-explain-a-complex-subject-to-a-non-technical-person">Describe a time you had to explain a complex subject to a non-technical person.<a class="hash-link" href="#describe-a-time-you-had-to-explain-a-complex-subject-to-a-non-technical-person" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Questions like this assess your communication skills. In particular, interviewers want to know if you can provide clear layperson descriptions of the technology and techniques in data engineering.</p><p>For example, you could say: “In a previous job, I was working on a data engineering project. For our developing credit-risk analysis tool, I needed to explain the differences between predictive models (using random forest, KNN, and decision trees). My approach was to distill the definition into easily understandable 1-2 sentence descriptions for each algorithm. Then, I created a short presentation with slides to walk the team through the pros and cons of all three algorithms.”</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="why-are-you-interested-in-working-at-our-company">Why are you interested in working at our company?<a class="hash-link" href="#why-are-you-interested-in-working-at-our-company" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>These questions are common and easy to fail if you haven’t thought through an answer. One option is to focus on the company culture and describe how that excites you about the position.</p><p>For example, “I’m interested in working at Google because of the company’s experimentation and engineering innovation history. I look forward to being presented with engineering problems requiring creative, outside-the-box solutions, and I also enjoy developing new tools to solve complex problems. I believe this role would challenge me and provide opportunities to develop novel approaches, which excites me about the role.”</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="how-would-you-describe-your-communication-style">How would you describe your communication style?<a class="hash-link" href="#how-would-you-describe-your-communication-style" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>One helpful tip for a question like this: Use an example to illustrate your communication style.</p><p>For example, you could say:“I would describe my communication style as assertive. I believe it’s essential to be direct in my project needs and not be afraid to ask questions and gather information.</p><p>In my previous position, I was the lead on an engineering project. Before we started, I met with all stakeholders and learned about their needs and wants. One issue that arose was timing, and I felt I would need more resources to keep the project on schedule, so I communicated this to the PM, and we were able to expand the engineering team to meet the tight deadline.”</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="tell-me-a-time-when-your-colleagues-disagreed-with-your-approach-what-did-you-do-to-address-their-concerns">Tell me a time when your colleagues disagreed with your approach. What did you do to address their concerns?<a class="hash-link" href="#tell-me-a-time-when-your-colleagues-disagreed-with-your-approach-what-did-you-do-to-address-their-concerns" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>When interviewers ask this question, they want to see that you can negotiate effectively with your coworkers. Like most behavioral questions, use the STAR method. State the business situation and the task you need to complete. State the objections your coworker had to your action. Do not try to downplay the complaints or write them off as “stupid”; you will appear arrogant and inflexible.</p><p>Hint: The most crucial part of your answer is how you resolved the dispute.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="please-provide-an-example-of-a-goal-you-did-not-meet-and-how-you-handled-it">Please provide an example of a goal you did not meet and how you handled it.<a class="hash-link" href="#please-provide-an-example-of-a-goal-you-did-not-meet-and-how-you-handled-it" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>This scenario is a variation of the failure question. With this question, a framework like STAR can help you describe the situation, the task, your actions, and the results. Remember: Your answer should provide clear insights into your resilience.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="how-do-you-handle-meeting-a-tight-deadline">How do you handle meeting a tight deadline?<a class="hash-link" href="#how-do-you-handle-meeting-a-tight-deadline" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>This question assesses your time management skills. Provide specific details on how you operate. You might say I approach projects by:</p><ul><li>Gathering stakeholder input</li><li>Developing a project timeline with clear milestones</li><li>Delegating the workload for the project</li><li>Tracking progress</li><li>Communicating with stakeholders</li></ul><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="tell-me-about-a-time-you-used-data-to-influence-a-decision-or-solve-a-problem">Tell me about a time you used data to influence a decision or solve a problem.<a class="hash-link" href="#tell-me-about-a-time-you-used-data-to-influence-a-decision-or-solve-a-problem" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>STAR is a great way to structure your answers to questions like these. You could say:</p><p>“My previous job was at a swiping-based dating app. We aimed to increase the number of applications submitted (through swiping). I built an elastic search model to help users see relevant jobs. The model would weigh previous employment information and then use a weighted flexible query on all the jobs within a 50-mile radius of the applicant. After A/B testing, we saw a 10-percent lift in applications, compared to the baseline model.”</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="talk-about-a-time-when-you-had-to-persuade-someone">Talk about a time when you had to persuade someone.<a class="hash-link" href="#talk-about-a-time-when-you-had-to-persuade-someone" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>This question addresses communication, but it also assesses cultural fit. The interviewer wants to know if you can collaborate and how you present your ideas to colleagues. Use an example in your response:</p><p>“In a previous role, I felt the baseline model we were using - a Naive Bayes recommender - wasn’t providing precise enough search results to users. I felt that we could obtain better results with an elastic search model. I presented my idea and an A/B testing strategy to persuade the team to test the idea. After the A/B test, the elastic search model outperformed the Naive Bayes recommender.”</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-data-engineering-projects-have-you-also-worked-on-which-was-most-rewarding">What data engineering projects have you also worked on? Which was most rewarding?<a class="hash-link" href="#what-data-engineering-projects-have-you-also-worked-on-which-was-most-rewarding" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>If you have professional experience, choose a project you worked on in a previous job. However, if this is your first job or an internship, you can cite a class or personal project. As you present a data science or data engineering project, be sure to include:</p><ul><li>Include an overview of the problem</li><li>Summarize your approach to the problem</li><li>Discuss your process and the actions you took</li><li>Define the results of the project</li><li>Include information about what you learned, challenges, and what you would do differently</li></ul><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-are-your-strengths-and-weaknesses">What are your strengths and weaknesses?<a class="hash-link" href="#what-are-your-strengths-and-weaknesses" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>When discussing strengths, ask yourself, “what sets me apart from others?”. Focus on those strengths you can back up with examples using the STAR method, showing how your strength solved a business issue. If you have no prior full-time work experience, feel free to mention takeaways or projects from classes you have taken or initiatives from past part-time jobs.</p><p>With weaknesses, interviewers want to know that you can recognize your limits and develop effective strategies to manage the flaws that affect your performance and the business.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="why-do-you-want-to-join-this-company">Why do you want to join this company?<a class="hash-link" href="#why-do-you-want-to-join-this-company" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Answer: My interest in data engineering began when I was working as a software engineer. I found that I was really interested in the process of designing, implementing, and supporting the data infrastructure. When I researched more about the role of a data engineer, I realized that it was the perfect combination of my technical skills and my interest in working with data. I want to join this company because I believe that it is at the forefront of data-driven decision-making. I am impressed by the company’s use of data to improve its products and services, and I believe that I can contribute to the company’s success in this area.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="tell-me-about-a-time-you-improved-a-data-related-process">Tell me about a time you improved a data-related process?<a class="hash-link" href="#tell-me-about-a-time-you-improved-a-data-related-process" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Answer: When I was working as a software engineer, I was tasked with designing and implementing a data ingestion pipeline that would take data from multiple sources and load it into a central data warehouse. The data sources were disparate and the data formats were inconsistent. I designed a process that used a combination of ETL and ELT techniques to cleanse and normalize the data. This process improved the data quality and made it easier for analysts to access the data.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="tell-me-about-a-time-when-you-had-to-explain-a-technical-concept-to-a-non-technical-audience">Tell me about a time when you had to explain a technical concept to a non-technical audience?<a class="hash-link" href="#tell-me-about-a-time-when-you-had-to-explain-a-technical-concept-to-a-non-technical-audience" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Answer: When I was redesigning our ETL process, I had to get resource approval from our leadership team. I created a presentation that explained the technical details of the process in layman’s terms. I also prepared a demo that showed how the process worked. This allowed the non-technical members of the team to understand the process and give their approval.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-have-you-learned-in-your-current-role">What have you learned in your current role?<a class="hash-link" href="#what-have-you-learned-in-your-current-role" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Answer: In my current role, I have learned how to design and implement data architectures that are scalable and efficient. I have also gained experience working with a variety of data sources, including structured and unstructured data. I have also learned how to use big data technologies, such as Hadoop and Spark, to process and analyze large datasets.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-was-the-maximum-size-of-data-that-you-have-analyzed-so-far">What was the maximum size of data that you have analyzed so far?<a class="hash-link" href="#what-was-the-maximum-size-of-data-that-you-have-analyzed-so-far" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Answer: In my current role, I have processed and analyzed datasets that are up to {{10}} GB in size.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="can-you-tell-me-about-your-current-projects">Can you tell me about your current projects?<a class="hash-link" href="#can-you-tell-me-about-your-current-projects" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Answer: I am currently working on a project to {{migrate our data warehouse from an on-premise solution to a cloud-based solution}}. I am also working on a project to improve our {{ETL pipeline}}. I am redesigning the process to make it more efficient and scalable.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-is-the-difference-between-star-and-snowflake-schema">What is the difference between star and snowflake schema?<a class="hash-link" href="#what-is-the-difference-between-star-and-snowflake-schema" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Answer: Star schema is a type of data warehouse schema that is optimized for query performance. The snowflake schema is a type of data warehouse schema that is normalized for storage efficiency.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="can-you-explain-the-simpsons-paradox-to-me">Can you explain the Simpson’s Paradox to me?<a class="hash-link" href="#can-you-explain-the-simpsons-paradox-to-me" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Answer: The Simpson’s Paradox is a statistical phenomenon that occurs when the overall trend of a dataset is reversed when the data is grouped by another variable.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-is-the-goal-of-data-engineering">What is the goal of data engineering?<a class="hash-link" href="#what-is-the-goal-of-data-engineering" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Answer: The goal of data engineering is to design, build, and maintain efficient and reliable data infrastructure. Data engineers work with data architects to design the data architecture. They also work with software engineers to build the data infrastructure.

I am a diligent person who enjoys having responsibility for lots of tasks and I am comfortable working both on my own and as part of a team. Over the years I have built up experience in the field of analytics, helping customers, working under pressure, meeting tight deadlines, and solving problems. I understand FedEx has built up an incredible reputation for being reliable, punctual, and customer-focused, and if I am to succeed in this role, I will need to maintain concentration, follow company rules and procedures whilst at the same time ensuring I continually learn, grow, and develop.</p><p><strong>Q2) Why FedEx?</strong></p><p>Safety and quality are two very important values and principles of FedEx and having researched the organization prior to applying for this job, I soon realized this is place where I will be supported, where I will get to work alongside other enthusiastic, like-minded people, and where I will get to make a difference to your customer&#x27;s daily lives in the work I undertake. I am looking for long-term stable employment with the same company and in addition to feeling a sense of pride working for FedEx, it is important that I work in a role where I feel I am contributing to the team goals whilst at the same time growing and developing both personally and professionally.</p><p><strong>Why should we hire you</strong>?</p><p>I am versatile which means I can turn my hand to most things I will take on duties outside of my job description and I will be flexible and adaptable to help out the company at short notice whenever needed you should hire me because my high standards passion for my work and enthusiasms mean I would be a great role model for the organization whenever dealing with customers finally you should hire me because I take ownership of difficult challenges if I encounter a problem I will do all I can to solve it instead of simply passing on the issue to my manager or supervisor but then to deal</p><p><strong>Describe yourself in 3 words?</strong></p><p>I would describe myself as diligent, energetic, and loyal. I am diligent because I work hard, I follow instructions carefully and I complete things on time and to the requested standard I am energetic which means I tend to get more work done than the average person finally I am loyal which means I will always be a positive role model for the company and I will stay working here for the long term and become a part of your ongoing success.</p><p><strong>Q3. How would you resolve an issue with a co-worker?</strong></p><p>I would resolve it as soon as possible because any form of conflict can hinder the team&#x27;s goals. I would first of all looks to see if I were doing anything that might be contributing to the conflict. If I was, I would change it. I would speak to the person whom I had the issue with to see if we can reach a compromise, put aside our differences and move forward positively. With any form of conflict in the workplace, communication is vital, so I would seek to get things back to normal quickly. If we were unable to sort out the problem collaboratively, I would suggest we speak to our manager or supervisor for guidance.</p><p><strong>Q4. Tell me about a time when you held someone accountable for not doing their job properly?</strong>
In my previous job I noticed a member of our team started making regular mistakes that had the potential to impact on our goals. As soon as I noticed the mistakes happening, I spoke to him in private to first of all ascertain if everything was OK. His response was quite defensive and so I went on to explain that I was concerned about the number of mistakes he was making and that it could not only be dangerous, but the mistakes would also impact on the service we were providing to our customers. After he had listened to what I had to say, he confided in me that he&#x27;d been burning the candle at both ends and that he wasn&#x27;t getting enough sleep. He told me he was going to make some changes to his lifestyle and since that day, he never made another mistake again.</p><p><strong>Tell me about a time when you had to make a decision with limited information?</strong></p><p>I was dealing with a customer on the telephone in a previous job and they were complaining that the order they had received was missing a bonus product my work colleague had promised to send to them because they were a loyal customer. My work colleague who had dealt with them was off on holiday for a week, so I had no way of checking the accuracy of this information. I weighed up the options with the limited information I had available, and I agreed to send them the additional bonus product first class post. In the circumstances it was important to make sure a high level of customer service was maintained, and whilst I would normally have waited to confirm the accuracy of the information with my colleague once he returned to work, I did not have the option to do so on this occasion.</p><p><strong>Talk me through the responsibilities you will have whilst working at FedEx? (NEED TO CHANGE )</strong></p><p>There are many different responsibilities and daily duties I will have as a delivery driver and these include, ensuring all safety procedures and traffic regulations are adhered to at all timespicking up and dropping off parcels at designated locations; providing great customer service at all times, and also making sure I follow my planned route reaching all destinations on time according to the schedule. I will also need to keep customers updated, make sure my truck/van is safe, clean and serviceable and also perform any basic maintenance checks periodically in line with the FedEx&#x27;s company guidelines.</p><p><strong>Why should we hire you to work at FedEx?</strong></p><p>There comes a huge amount of responsibility working for FedEx. I studied the role prior to applying for this job, and I am confident I have the necessary skills, qualities, and the aptitude to meet the demands of the role. Coming from a background where I have put customers need at the forefront, I will always make sure to give the best analytical solutions to my customers and help them derive the most benefits from the services provided to them. Finally, I can also be relied upon to represent your company in a positive manner, and I will always act with the highest levels of integrity and professionalism when dealing with customers who use the FedEx service.</p><p><strong>What&#x27;s your biggest weakness?</strong></p><p>I don&#x27;t have many weaknesses, but there is one I have been aware of for some time, and that&#x27;s the fact that I find it hard to say no to people. In the past, I have literally taken on so many tasks that I get a bit overwhelmed, I feel that this doesn&#x27;t really look like a weakness from another person&#x27;s point of view, but it could reflect on me badly if I am unable to finish a task that I promised, and it might decrease my credibility among my peers. Hence, I&#x27;ve been learning to take on fewer tasks to make sure they are all done to the right standard.</p><p><strong>Q22. What are your strengths?</strong></p><p>I believe I have a number of key strengths and qualities that would be highly useful within this role. I have always been a team player while making sure that I am competent enough to carry out tasks on my own, and I am also flexible and adaptable, which means I can work with different teams with ease and get the job done. I am honest, reliable and trustworthy and I can be relied upon to maintain competence in my role here at FedEx. Finally, I will always be fit for work and I will also make sure I provide exceptional customer service at all times whist working for FedEx.</p><p><strong>Describe a stressful situation at work and how you handled it?</strong></p><p>There was a client portfolio that was transferred to me, and I had to meet them at their head office as the new data analyst who would be assisting them. The client seemed very agitated and were a bit abusive .They were very unhappy about the fact that their KPI&#x27;s were and claimed that the analysts working previously did not provide the desirable support. I apologized and I recorded all their concerns .After I touched base I started analysis their business requirements , looked at all their open jira tickets and started giving a few extra hours for about a month&#x27;s time to make sure that I am top of every issue faced by the client. The clients review drastically changed in our following stake holder meeting and I was successful in retaining and extending the clients contract with our company. Whenever there are stressful situations at work , I feel I am at my best. I always remain resilient during stressful situations and focus on what I want to achieve. Dealing with stress at work is all part and parcel of everyday life and I would always be determined to see things through to a successful resolution.</p><p><strong>Where do you see yourself in 5 years&#x27; time?</strong></p><p>In five years, I see myself progressing within the company to the point where not only am not only well-respected in the role, but I&#x27;ve also taken on further responsibilities. I believe that, in five years&#x27; time, I will have proven myself as an invaluable member of the FedEx team. I would also take great pleasure in assisting the training and development of newer employees who occupy a similar role and I see myself working on predictive analytics and machine learning in a data science setting within the company.</p><p><strong>Describe a time when you had to handle a difficult customer?</strong></p><p>I had worked with a client in the past who dealt with digital learning and provided online courses to kids in primary school. The client had a required of integrating whatsapp as one of their communication channels. This request came in on a Thursday and the client wanted to get the task done by Friday EOD and wouldn&#x27;t understand that such integrations took about 3 to 4 days to integrate, test and then deploy on live environment. I took this as a challenge and got hold of clients technical team.</p></div><footer class="theme-doc-footer docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="theme-doc-footer-edit-meta-row row"><div class="col"></div><div class="col lastUpdated_vwxv"><span class="theme-last-updated">Last updated<!-- --> on <b><time datetime="2023-04-22T14:58:27.000Z">Apr 22, 2023</time></b> by <b>sparsh</b></span></div></div></footer></article><nav class="pagination-nav docusaurus-mt-lg" aria-label="Docs pages navigation"></nav></div></div><div class="col col--3"><div class="tableOfContents_bqdL thin-scrollbar theme-doc-toc-desktop"><ul class="table-of-contents table-of-contents__left-border"><li><a href="#describe-a-data-engineering-problem-you-have-faced-what-were-some-challenges" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">Describe a data engineering problem you have faced.
