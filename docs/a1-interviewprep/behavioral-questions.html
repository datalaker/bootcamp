id="tell-me-about-yourself">Tell me about yourself<a class="hash-link" href="#tell-me-about-yourself" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h4><p>Three Key Points: 1) Skills and qualities, 2) Any relevant Experience, and 3) What you are going to do in the role if you&#x27;re successful.</p><p>“I am a positive, enthusiastic person who has a track record of carrying out tasks on time and to a high standard. I am a diligent person who enjoys having responsibility for lots of tasks and I am comfortable working both on my own and as part of a team. Over the years I have built up experience in the field of analytics, helping customers, working under pressure, meeting tight deadlines, and solving problems. I understand FedEx has built up an incredible reputation for being reliable, punctual, and customer-focused, and if I am to succeed in this role, I will need to maintain concentration, follow company rules and procedures whilst at the same time ensuring I continually learn, grow, and develop.”</p><p>“I would describe myself as diligent, energetic, and loyal. I am diligent because I work hard, I follow instructions carefully and I complete things on time and to the requested standard I am energetic which means I tend to get more work done than the average person finally I am loyal which means I will always be a positive role model for the company and I will stay working here for the long term and become a part of your ongoing success.”</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="why-do-you-want-to-be-a-data-engineer">Why do you want to be a Data Engineer?<a class="hash-link" href="#why-do-you-want-to-be-a-data-engineer" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h4><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="where-do-you-see-yourself-in-5-years">Where do you see yourself in 5 years?<a class="hash-link" href="#where-do-you-see-yourself-in-5-years" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h4><p>“I aspire to become a Data Architect. In this role, I would be responsible for designing the data architecture for the company. I would also work with software engineers, data scientists, and data analysts to build the data infrastructure. Additionally, I would work with data analysts and data scientists to ensure that the data infrastructure is able to support the needs of the business.”</p><p>“In five years, I see myself progressing within the company to the point where not only am not only well-respected in the role, but I&#x27;ve also taken on further responsibilities. I believe that, in five years&#x27; time, I will have proven myself as an invaluable member of the FedEx team. I would also take great pleasure in assisting the training and development of newer employees who occupy a similar role and I see myself working on predictive analytics and machine learning in a data science setting within the company.”</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="why-do-you-want-to-work-at-our-company">Why do you want to work at our company?<a class="hash-link" href="#why-do-you-want-to-work-at-our-company" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h4><p>These questions are common and easy to fail if you haven’t thought through an answer. One option is to focus on the company culture and describe how that excites you about the position.</p><p>For example, “I’m interested in working at Google because of the company’s experimentation and engineering innovation history. I look forward to being presented with engineering problems requiring creative, outside-the-box solutions, and I also enjoy developing new tools to solve complex problems. I believe this role would challenge me and provide opportunities to develop novel approaches, which excites me about the role.”</p><p>“My interest in data engineering began when I was working as a software engineer. I found that I was really interested in the process of designing, implementing, and supporting the data infrastructure. When I researched more about the role of a data engineer, I realized that it was the perfect combination of my technical skills and my interest in working with data. I want to join this company because I believe that it is at the forefront of data-driven decision-making. I am impressed by the company’s use of data to improve its products and services, and I believe that I can contribute to the company’s success in this area.”</p><p>“I want to gain experience working with a variety of data sources and technologies. I also want to learn how to design and implement efficient and scalable data architectures.

Use an example in your response:</p><p>“In a previous role, I felt the baseline model we were using - a Naive Bayes recommender - wasn’t providing precise enough search results to users. I felt that we could obtain better results with an elastic search model. I presented my idea and an A/B testing strategy to persuade the team to test the idea.
