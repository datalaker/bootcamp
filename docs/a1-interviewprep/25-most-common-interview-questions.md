ETL is often used to integrate data from multiple sources and to prepare data for analysis or reporting.

#### Can you explain the difference between batch and stream processing?

Batch processing involves processing data in large chunks at regular intervals, while stream processing involves processing data in real-time as it is generated. Batch processing is typically used for data that is not time-sensitive and can be processed in bulk, while stream processing is used for data that needs to be processed and analyzed as quickly as possible, such as real-time sensor data or social media feeds.

#### How do you handle data integration from multiple sources?

To handle data integration from multiple sources, you need to identify the data sources, determine the relationships between them, extract and transform the data, load the data into a central repository, and monitor and maintain the integration on an ongoing basis.

#### What is a data mart and how does it differ from a data warehouse?

A data mart is a subset of a data warehouse that is designed to support the reporting and analysis needs of a specific department or business unit. It typically contains a subset of the data in the data warehouse and is optimized for fast querying and analysis. A data mart differs from a data warehouse in that it is focused on a specific business area or function, whereas a data warehouse is designed to support the overall data needs of an organization.

#### Can you explain the concept of data governance?

Data governance is the process of defining and enforcing policies, procedures, and standards for managing and securing data within an organization. It involves establishing roles and responsibilities for data management, defining data quality and security standards, and establishing processes for data integration, access, and retention.

#### How do you handle security and privacy in data engineering?

Ensuring the security and privacy of data is an important part of data engineering. This involves implementing measures such as access controls, encryption, and data masking to protect data from unauthorized access or disclosure. It also involves ensuring that data is stored and processed in compliance with relevant laws and regulations, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the EU.

#### Can you explain the concept of data lineage?

Data lineage is the process of tracking the origin and history of data as it moves through the various stages of a data pipeline. It involves documenting the sources of the data, the transformations applied to the data, and the destinations where the data is stored or used. Data lineage is important for understanding the reliability and accuracy of data, as well as for tracing the impact of data on downstream processes and systems.

#### How do you ensure data quality in a data pipeline?

Ensuring data quality in a data pipeline involves implementing processes and controls to ensure that the data being processed is accurate, complete, and consistent. This may involve validating the data against defined standards, cleansing the data to remove errors or inconsistencies, and monitoring the data for changes or deviations from expected values.

#### Can you explain the concept of data normalization and denormalization?

Data normalization is the process of organizing a database in a way that minimizes redundancy and dependency, while denormalization is the process of optimizing a database for faster querying and reporting by introducing redundancy.
