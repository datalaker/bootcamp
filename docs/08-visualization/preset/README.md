# Apache Superset - Preset

## Setup Preset

Go to https://preset.io/ and Click on “Start for free” button at the top-right corner. Follow the instructions to create a free account there. You can skip the database connection part, we will connect to the database later.

## RDP Client

Unless you have already an RDP client available on your laptop, you need to install one now so that you can connect to a Windows instance that you will use during the workshop. Follow the specific instructions for your operating system to install an RDP client, preferably Microsoft Remote Desktop 10.

- Windows Setup: Microsoft Remote Desktop is likely already included in your Windows operating system. To verify, type mstsc at a Command Prompt window. If it's not already included, you can obtain it through the [Microsoft Store](https://www.microsoft.com/p/microsoft-remotedesktop/9wzdncrfj3ps).
- MacOS Setup: Microsoft Remote Desktop 10 for macOS is available from the [Mac App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/microsoft-remote-desktop-10/id1295203466).
- Linux Setup: Microsoft Remote Desktop is not available for Linux, but you can use [Remmina](https://remmina.org/) instead.
