Tracking brand sentiment allows mission management to detect misleading or inaccurate information posted to social and have the distributed mission team members respond to negative posts as soon as possible.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="ste-0-problem-understanding">Ste 0: Problem Understanding<a class="hash-link" href="#ste-0-problem-understanding" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-is-the-problem">What is the problem?<a class="hash-link" href="#what-is-the-problem" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Public perception of a mission could be harshly influenced by invalid or mis-information on social media. The brand of the mission, its core management and operations teams could be negatively impacted by unfairly critical or inaccurate tweets posted to Twitter. Team members are well-versed in the details of the mission and have clarity around its scientific goals. They are best equipped to respond to such posts to clarify or correct discrepencies related to the topic being discussed.</p><p>With access to such tweets on Twitter, the mission team can make these clarifications faster and more efficient. Indeed brand monitoring and customer support are two of the business use-cases of sentiment analysis (<a href="https://monkeylearn.com/blog/sentiment-analysis-examples/#:~:text=Expressions%20can%20be%20classified%20as%20positive%2C%20negative%2C%20or,which%20can%20be%20used%20across%20industries%20and%20teams." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1</a>).</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="who-does-it-impact-and-how-much">Who does it impact and how much?<a class="hash-link" href="#who-does-it-impact-and-how-much" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>It impacts everyone involved in planning and running the mission. It undermines efforts made to</p><ul><li>mitigate even minor failures by the mission engineering team</li><li>ensure useful science experiments are being conducted by the mission</li></ul><p>It is difficult to estimate the cost of having negative sentiment about a mission pervasive on social media. However, negative <a href="https://www.encyclopedia.com/reference/culture-magazines/public-opinion-about-space-exploration" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">public sentiment about any aspect of a space mission</a> incorrectly undermines the mission managers and space agencies (NASA, ESA, CSA) involved in laying out robust scientific objectives for the mission. This subsequently undermines the ability to fund future missions.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="how-is-it-being-solved-today-and-what-are-some-of-the-gaps">How is it being solved today and what are some of the gaps?<a class="hash-link" href="#how-is-it-being-solved-today-and-what-are-some-of-the-gaps" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Tweets with a negative sentiment can be identified by a human reading them and interpreting the text. Without reading all tweets related to the mission (eg. tweets containing a well-defined set of keywords), it is impossible to identify such tweets.</p><p>The current approach to pick out negative sentiment tweets involves randomly guessing at the sentiment of a tweet. This picks up some positive sentiment tweets as well. Unfortunately, when the randomly guessed twets are flagged to mission team members for review, they have to read the positive sentiment tweets (that are actually not of a concern), which slows them down when responding to the harmful or inaccurate tweets and is time-consuming.</p><p>Therefore, a more accurate approach to identifying tweets that</p><ul><li>contain text from a well-defined set of mission-related keywords</li><li>have a negative sentiment</li></ul><p>is required in order to respond to them faster and more effectively than being done currently.</p><p>We should note that the mission team may wish to spend time reading a sampling or (depending on the number of tweets) all of the positive sentiment tweets, but these are a lower priority than reading (and responding to) the negative sentiment tweets. Moving forward through this project, we will assume that positive sentiment tweets will not be read.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="step-1-goals">Step 1: Goals<a class="hash-link" href="#step-1-goals" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-are-the-goals-of-the-project">What are the goals of the project?<a class="hash-link" href="#what-are-the-goals-of-the-project" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>The objective of this project is to minimize harmful sentiment on Twitter about the mission in the public domain.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="how-will-we-know-if-our-project-is-successful">How will we know if our project is successful?<a class="hash-link" href="#how-will-we-know-if-our-project-is-successful" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>The project will be successful if the ML-based approach to predicting if support is needed is more accurate than a naive approach (random guessing).
