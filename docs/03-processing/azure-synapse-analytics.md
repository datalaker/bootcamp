# Azure Synapse Analytics

Azure Synapse Analytics workspaces generation 2, formally released in December 2020, is the industry-leading big data solution for processing and consolidating data of business value. Azure Synapse Analytics has three important components:

* SQL pools and Spark pools for performing data exploration and processing
* Integration pipelines for performing data ingestion and data transformations
* Power BI integration for data visualization

Having data ingestion, processing, and visualization capabilities in a single service with seamless integration with all other services makes Azure Synapse Analytics a very powerful tool in big data engineering projects.

## Azure Synapse Data Flows

Azure Synapse data flows allow us to perform transformations on the data such as converting data format, filtering, merging, and sorting while moving the data from the source to the destination. The best part about Synapse data flows is the user-friendly interface that allows us to perform complex data transformations in a few clicks.
