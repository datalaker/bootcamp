> Advanced Data Engineering with Databricks

## Introduction

In this course, students will build upon their existing knowledge of Apache Spark, Structured Streaming, and Delta Lake to unlock the full potential of the data lakehouse by utilizing the suite of tools provided by Databricks. This course places a heavy emphasis on designs favoring incremental data processing, enabling systems optimized to continuously ingest and analyze ever-growing data. By designing workloads that leverage built-in platform optimizations, data engineers can reduce the burden of code maintenance and on-call emergencies, and quickly adapt production code to new demands with minimal refactoring or downtime. The topics in this course should be mastered prior to attempting the Databricks Certified s Data Engineering Professional exam.Â
