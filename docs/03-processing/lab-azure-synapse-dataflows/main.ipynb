    "Behind the scenes, Synapse Analytics data flows use tasks in Spark clusters to perform data flow transformations. When observing the partition statistics on the sink1 transformation in step 2 of the How to do it… section, we noticed that 1,009 rows were split across 200 partitions. Typically, we would like to have at least a few thousand rows per partition (or 10 MB to 100 MB in size). Having 4 to 6 rows per partition makes any transformation slow and hence, the sort operation was slow as well. Having too many partitions implies that the backend jobs spend a lot of time creating many partitions. This becomes overkill when there are just a few rows per partition and most of the time is spent on creating partitions rather than processing the data inside them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Switching the partition settings to Single partition via the sink transformation’s Optimize setting creates a single partition for all 1,009 rows, performs the sort activity in a single partition, and returns the results quickly. Had there been, say, a few hundred thousand or a few million rows for the sort activity, having multiple partitions would have been a better bet.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data flows for each transformation, by default, use the setting called current partitioning, which implies that the data flow will estimate the optimal number of partitions for that transformation based on the size of the data. Setting a single partition as done in this recipe is not recommended for all scenarios – however, it is equally important to track the partition count for transformations and make adjustments if required."

    "1. Click on the column1 mapping and hit the delete button. Check the checkbox next to Each column that matches and type in position > 8. Type $$ in both textboxes, on the left and right. By specifying position > 8, for each column after position number 8 in the list of columns read by the Mapdrifted1 transformation, the data flow will dynamically create a new column. As all our columns after position 8 (counting the columns from left to right) are derived columns (new columns), we have configured the data mapping to automatically create columns for them. $$ represents the value of the column and by specifying $$ in the left- and right-hand text boxes, we are accepting the values in the columns as they are:\n",

    "1. A key objective is to separate the derived columns and originally mapped columns into two streams so that the original data transformation from source to sink doesn’t break and the expected columns are transferred as planned from the CSV file to the Parquet destination. To achieve this, we can configure a fixed rule mapping for the Parquet sink transformation. Click on the Parquet sink transformation and go to the Mapping section. The original columns are automatically listed. Check the checkbox next to Input columns to map all eight original columns that are expected to be copied to the Parquet destination folder.\n",
    "1. Now, let’s get the primary key and the drifted columns into a separate stream. Click on the + symbol on the right-hand side of the MapDrifted1 transformation again and add Sink. This sink will serve as the secondary path for tracking whether there are any drifted columns from the source.\n",
    "1. For the purpose of testing, we set Sink type to Cache. You can set the sink for the drifted columns to a Parquet dataset (or any integration dataset) if you wish to store the values of the drifted column.\n",
    "1. Click on the newly added sink1 transformation (the cache sink) and go to the Mapping section. Disable Auto mapping. Delete all mapping except the mapping for the tid column, as shown in the following screenshot. Once done, click Add mapping and select Rule-based mapping. Rule-based mapping helps us to dynamically create and define columns based on the column patterns:\n",

    "1. For Rule-based mapping, specify the column pattern as position > 8 and the value as $$, which implies that columns from any position after 8 will be used as they are, as in step 10. Check the tid mapping and the Rule-based mapping checkboxes.\n",
    "1. Click Data preview and hit the Refresh button to see the tid column and the derived columns only.\n",

    "Schema drifting and rule-based mapping offer resilience and flexibility for the pipelines to accommodate almost any kind of change made at the data source. In this recipe, we used the Map drifted columns option and a derived columns transformation in step 7 and step 8 to identify the unplanned or the new columns for the source. We split the new columns using rule-based mapping to flow to a separate sink (a cache sink for testing) and ensured that the originally expected columns flowed to the Parquet destination using fixed rule mapping. Using the preceding recipe, data engineers can ensure that their pipelines transfer data as expected, but they can also track any new columns that are added to the source and can make adjustments to their pipelines if required."
