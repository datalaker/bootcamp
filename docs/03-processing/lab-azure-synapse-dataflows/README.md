# Transforming Data Using Azure Synapse Dataflows

This lab focuses on performing transformations using Synapse Dataflows, optimizing data flows using partitioning, and managing dynamic source schema changes using schema drifting

- Recipe 1 - Copying data using a Synapse data flow
- Recipe 2 - Performing data transformation using activities such as join, sort, and filter
- Recipe 3 - Monitoring data flows and pipelines
- Recipe 4 - Configuring partitions to optimize data flows
- Recipe 5 - Parameterizing mapping data flows
- Recipe 6 - Handling schema changes dynamically in data flows using schema drift
