# Apache Beam

## What is apache beam?

Apache Beam is a library for parallel data processing. Beam is commonly used for Extract, Transform, and Load (ETL), batch, and stream processing. It does particularly well with large amounts of data since it can use mutliple machines to process everything at the same time.

Apache Beam comprises four basic features:

1. Pipeline - Pipeline is responsible for reading, processing, and saving the data. This whole cycle is a pipeline starting from the input until its entire circle to output. Every Beam program is capable of generating a Pipeline.
2. PCollection - It is equivalent to RDD or DataFrames in Spark. The pipeline creates a PCollection by reading data from a data source, and after that, more PCollections keep on developing as PTransforms are applied to it.
3. PTransform - Each PTransform on PCollection results in a new PCollection making it immutable. Once constructed, you will not be able to configure individual items in a PCollection. A transformation onPCollection will result in a new PCollection. The features in a PCollection can be of any type, but all must be of the same kind. However, to maintain disseminated processing, Beam encodes each element as a byte string so that Beam can pass around items to distributed workers.
4. Runner - It determines where this pipeline will operate.

In Beam, your data lives in a **`PCollection`**, which stands for *Parallel Collection*. A `PCollection` is like a **list of elements**, but without any order guarantees. This allows Beam to easily parallelize and distribute the `PCollection`'s elements.

Once you have your data, the next step is to transform it. In Beam, you transform data using **`PTransform`**s, which stands for *Parallel Transform*. A `PTransform` is like a **function**, they take some inputs, transform them and create some outputs.

We pass the elements from step1 through step3 and save the results into `outputs`.

```py
outputs = pipeline | step1 | step2 | step3
```

This is equivalent to the example above.

```py
outputs = (
  pipeline
  | step1
  | step2
  | step3
)
```

Also, Beam expects each transform, or step, to have a unique *label*, or description. This makes it a lot easier to debug, and it's in general a good practice to start. You can use the *right shift operator* `>>` to add a label to your transforms, like `'My description' >> MyTransform`.

Try to give short but descriptive labels.

```py
outputs = (
  pipeline
  | 'First step' >> step1
  | 'Second step' >> step2
  | 'Third step' >> step3
)
```
