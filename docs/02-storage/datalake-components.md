# Components of the cloud data lake architecture

There are four key components that create the foundation and serve as building blocks for the cloud data lake architecture. These components are:

1. The data itself - structured, semi-structured and unstructured data
2. The data lake storage - e.g. Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service), Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS) and Google Cloud Storage (GCS)
3. The big data analytics engines that process the data - e.g. Apache Hadoop, Apache Spark and Real-time stream processing pipelines
4. The cloud data warehouse - e.g. Amazon RedShift, Google BigQuery, Azure Synapse Analytics and Snowflake Data Platform
