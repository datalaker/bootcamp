# Database Storage Engines

To round out the discussion of serialization, we briefly discuss database storage engines. All databases have an underlying storage engine; many donâ€™t expose their storage engines as a separate abstraction (for example, BigQuery, Snowflake). Some (notably, MySQL) support fully pluggable storage engines. Others (e.g., SQL Server) offer major storage engine configuration options (columnar versus row-based storage) that dramatically affect database behavior.

Typically, the storage engine is a separate software layer from the query engine. The storage engine manages all aspects of how data is stored on a disk, including serialization, the physical arrangement of data, and indexes.

Storage engines have seen significant innovation in the 2000s and 2010s. While storage engines in the past were optimized for direct access to spinning disks, modern storage engines are much better optimized to support the performance characteristics of SSDs. Storage engines also offer improved support for modern types and data structures, such as variable-length strings, arrays, and nested data.

Another major change in storage engines is a shift toward columnar storage for analytics and data warehouse applications. SQL Server, PostgreSQL, and MySQL offer robust columnar storage support.
