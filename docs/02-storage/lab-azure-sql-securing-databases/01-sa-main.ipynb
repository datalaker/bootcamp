    "Azure SQL Database, a fundamental relational database as a service offered in Azure, acts as a source, destination, or even as an intermediate storage layer in data engineering pipelines. Azure SQL Database can be used to consolidate data coming from several relational data sources and build mini data warehouses or data marts. With the introduction of Hyperscale tier in Azure SQL Database, the capacity of Azure SQL Database has increased leaps and bounds too. Securing Azure SQL Database is also pivotal in protecting access to the database. Having a strong understanding of Azure SQL Database's capabilities and security options is essential for any data engineer.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. Execute the following PowerShell command to create a new resource group:\n",

    "    New-AzResourceGroup -Name sparsh-resource-1 -Location \"eastus\"\n",
    "    ```\n",

    "1. To connect to an Azure SQL database, let’s first whitelist the IP address in the Azure SQL Server firewall. Execute the following command to whitelist the public IP address of the machine to connect to an Azure SQL database (this recipe assumes that you are connecting from your local system. To connect from a system other than your local system, change the IP address in the following command). Execute the following command in the PowerShell window to whitelist the machine’s public IP address in the Azure SQL Server firewall:\n",

There are multiple SQL database editions to choose from based on the application workload. However, for the sake of this demo, we will create a basic edition.\n",

    "\n",
    "We can connect to an Azure SQL database from SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS), SQLCMD, or Azure Data Studio, or with a programming language using the appropriate SQL Server drivers. When connecting to an Azure SQL database, we need to specify the server name as azuresqlservername.database.windows.net, and then specify the Azure SQL database to connect to."

For example, consider 20 different SQL databases with varying usage patterns, each S3 Standard storage class requiring 100 database throughput units (DTUs) to run. We need to pay for 100 DTUs separately. However, we can group all of them in an elastic pool of S3 Standard storage classes. In this case, we only need to pay for elastic pool pricing and not for each individual SQL database.\n",
