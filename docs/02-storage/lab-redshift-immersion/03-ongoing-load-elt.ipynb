    "Stored procedures are commonly used to encapsulate logic for data transformation, data validation, and business-specific logic. By combining multiple SQL steps into a stored procedure, you can reduce round trips between your applications and the database. A stored procedure can incorporate data definition language (DDL) and data manipulation language (DML) in addition to SELECT queries. A stored procedure doesn’t have to return a value. You can use the PL/pgSQL procedural language, including looping and conditional expressions, to control logical flow.\n",

    "In a data warehouse environment, applications often need to perform complex queries on large tables—for example, SELECT statements that perform multi-table joins and aggregations on the tables that contain billions of rows. Processing these queries can be expensive in terms of system resources and the time it takes to compute the results.\n",
    "\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This query takes time to execute and because it is scanning a large amount of data will use a lot of I/O & CPU resources. Think of a situation, where multiple users in the organization need get supplier-level metrics like the above. Each may write similarly heavy queries which can be time consuming and expensive operations. Instead of that you can use a materialized view to store precomputed results for speeding up queries that are predictable and repeated.\n",
