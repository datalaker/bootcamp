# Lab: Intro to DynamoDB

## Description

Amazon DynamoDB is a NoSQL Database in the cloud, suitable for anyone needing a reliable and fully managed NoSQL solution. DynamoDB is designed to provide automated storage scaling and low latency. It is particularly useful when your application must read and store massive amounts of data and you need speed and reliability (Amazon works with replicas of your database in three different Availability Zones). Amazon DynamoDB is totally managed. You simply select an AWS region, define the needed indexes for each table you will create, and Amazon takes care of everything else.

During this lab, you will learn how to create DynamoDB tables, with and without local or global secondary indexes, and how to manage your table data. You will also figure out how to add, edit, query, export, and delete table data using the AWS Management Console.
