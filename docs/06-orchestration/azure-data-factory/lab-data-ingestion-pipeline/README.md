# Lab: Building Data Ingestion Pipelines Using Azure Data Factory

Azure Data Factory is the bread and butter for a data engineer and understanding its fundamentals is extremely essential in building efficient pipelines. By the end of the lab, you will know how to provision a data factory account, copy data from an Azure SQL database to a data lake using copy activity, use control flow activities, move data from SQL Server to a data lake, and choose options to trigger a data factory pipeline.

In this lab, weâ€™ll cover the following recipes:

* Provisioning Azure Data Factory
* Copying files to a database from a data lake using a control flow and copy activity
* Triggering a pipeline in Azure Data Factory
* Copying data from a SQL Server virtual machine to a data lake using the Copy data wizard
