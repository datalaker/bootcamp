# Postgres Pagila

## Objective

Create a star schema from 3NF schema on DVD rental Pagila dataset

Build a Postgres data model of Pagila dataset

## Introduction

Pagila is a dataset representing a DVD rental store (remember those?!), containing information about films (like title, category, actresses), rental stores (like address, staff members, customers) and rentals, where a customer rents a film from a store through its staff.

With all these relational information, Pagila is a perfect fit to play around with PostgreSQL and the SQL language.

In this lab, we will use this Pagila dataset to build a data model in Postgres.
