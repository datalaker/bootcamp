As simple as it sounds, this is still an area of active research in the field. In traditional DWH, the operational system(s) are kept separate from the DWH for a good reason.
The Operational systems are designed to accept inputs or changes to data regularly, hence have a good chance of being regularly queried. On the other hand, a DWH is supposed to do just the opposite - it is used to query data for reports only. No changes to data, through user actions is expected (or designed). The only inputs could come from the ETL feed at stipulated times.
The ETL would source its data from the Operational systems just explained above.
To create a real-time DWH we would have to merge both systems (several ways are being explored), a concept that is against the reason of creating a DWH. Bigger challenges occur in terms of updating aggregated data in facts at real time, still maintaining the surrogate keys.
Besides, we would need lightening fast hardware to try this.Near Real time DWH is a trade-off between the conventional design and the dream of all clients today. The frequency of ETL updates in higher in this case for e.g. once in 2 hours. We can also analyze and use selective refreshes at shorter time intervals, while complete refreshes may still be kept further apart. Selective refreshes would look at only those tables that get updated regularly.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-is-type-2-version-dimension">What is Type 2 Version Dimension?<a class="hash-link" href="#what-is-type-2-version-dimension" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Version dimension is the SCD type II in real time it using because of it will maintain the current data and full historical data.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-are-data-modeling-and-data-mining">What are Data Modeling and Data Mining?<a class="hash-link" href="#what-are-data-modeling-and-data-mining" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Data modeling is the process of designing a data base model.

A hierarchy can be used to define data aggregation. For example, in a time dimension, a hierarchy might aggregate data from the month level to the quarter level to the year level. A hierarchy can also be used to define a navigational drill path and to establish a family structure.Within a hierarchy, each level is logically connected to the levels above and below it. Data values at lower levels aggregate into the data values at higher levels. A dimension can be composed of more than one hierarchy. For example, in the product dimension, there might be two hierarchies--one for product categories and one for product suppliers.Dimension hierarchies also group levels from general to granular. Query tools use hierarchies to enable you to drill down into your data to view different levels of granularity. This is one of the key benefits of a data warehouse.When designing hierarchies, you must consider the relationships in business structures. Hierarchies impose a family structure on dimension values. For a particular level value, a value at the next higher level is its parent, and values at the next lower level are its children. These familial relationships enable analysts to access data quickly.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-are-data-validation-strategies-for-data-mart-validation-after-loading-process">What are Data Validation Strategies for Data Mart Validation after loading process?<a class="hash-link" href="#what-are-data-validation-strategies-for-data-mart-validation-after-loading-process" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Data validation is to make sure that the loaded data is accurate and meets the business requirements.

The only requirement for a surrogate primary key is that it is unique for each row in the table.
Data warehouses typically use a surrogate, (also known as artificial or identity key), key for the dimension tables primary keys. They can use Info sequence generator, or Oracle sequence, or SQL Server Identity values for the surrogate key.
It is useful because the natural primary key (i.e. Customer Number in Customer table) can change and this makes updates more difficult.
Some tables have columns such as AIRPORT_NAME OR CITY_NAME which are stated as the primary keys (according to the business users) but ,not only can these change, indexing on a numerical value is probably better and you could consider creating a surrogate key called, say, AIRPORT_ID. This would be internal to the system and as far as the client is concerned, you may display only the AIRPORT_NAME.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-is-a-linked-cube">What is a Linked Cube?<a class="hash-link" href="#what-is-a-linked-cube" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Linked cube in which a sub-set of the data can be analyzed into detail.

Since Chen wrote his paper the model has been extended and today it is commonly used for database design for the database designer, the utility of the ER model is: it maps well to the relational model. The constructs used in the ER model can easily be transformed into relational tables. It is simple and easy to understand with a minimum of training. Therefore, the database designer to communicate the design to the end user can use the model. In addition, the model can be used as a design plan by the database developer to implement a data model in specific database management software.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-is-the-difference-between-snowflake-and-star-schema-and-what-are-situations-where-snowflake-schema-is-better-than-star-schema">What is the difference between Snowflake and Star Schema and what are situations where Snowflake Schema is better than Star Schema?<a class="hash-link" href="#what-is-the-difference-between-snowflake-and-star-schema-and-what-are-situations-where-snowflake-schema-is-better-than-star-schema" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Star schema contains the dimension tables mapped around one or more fact tables.It is a renormalized model and no need to use complicated joins.

Most of the data warehouses in the world source data from multiple systems - systems that were created long before data warehousing was well understood, and hence without the vision to consolidate the same in a single repository of information. In such a scenario, the possibilities of the following are there:
► Missing information for a column from one of the data sources;
► Inconsistent information among different data sources;
► Orphan records;
► Outlier data points;
► Different data types for the same information among various data sources, leading to improper conversion;
► Data breaching business rules
In order to ensure that the data warehouse is not infected by any of these discrepancies, it is important to cleanse the data using a set of business rules, before it makes its way into the data warehouse.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="can-you-explain-the-hierarchies-level-data-warehousing">Can you explain the Hierarchies Level Data Warehousing?<a class="hash-link" href="#can-you-explain-the-hierarchies-level-data-warehousing" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>In Data warehousing, levels are columns available in dimension table.

That is, the dimension data has been grouped into multiple tables instead of one large table. For example, a product dimension table in a star schema might be normalized into a products table, a product_category table, and a product_manufacturer table in a snowflake schema. While this saves space, it increases the number of dimension tables and requires more foreign key joins. The result is more complex queries and reduced query performance.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-is-the-difference-between-oltp-and-olap">What is the difference between Oltp and Olap?<a class="hash-link" href="#what-is-the-difference-between-oltp-and-olap" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>OLTP is nothing but OnLine Transaction Processing ,which contains a normalised tables and online data,which have frequent insert/updates/delete.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="how-are-the-dimension-tables-designed">How are the Dimension Tables designed?<a class="hash-link" href="#how-are-the-dimension-tables-designed" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Find where data for this dimension are located.

When a disk fails then all the calls made to the data in that disk are redirected to the other disks when the data has been replicated.
At times replicas and disks are added online without having to move around the data in the existing copy or affect the arm movement of the disk.
In load balancing, Chain Data Replication has multiple servers within the data warehouse share data request processing since data already have replicas in each server disk.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="explain-in-brief-various-fundamental-stages-of-data-warehousing">Explain in brief various fundamental stages of Data Warehousing.<a class="hash-link" href="#explain-in-brief-various-fundamental-stages-of-data-warehousing" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>The following are the stages of data warehousing:

Relationships may be created and maintained across and among the data and tables. In a relational database, relationships between data items are expressed by means of tables. Interdependencies among these tables are expressed by data values rather than by pointers. This allows a high degree of data independence. An RDBMS has the capability to recombine the data items from different files, providing powerful tools for data usage.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-is-normalization">What is Normalization?<a class="hash-link" href="#what-is-normalization" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Database normalization is a data design and organization process applied to data structures based on rules that help build relational databases. In relational database design, the process of organizing data to minimize redundancy. Normalization usually involves dividing a database into two or more tables and defining relationships between the tables. The objective is to isolate data so that additions, deletions, and modifications of a field can be made in just one table and then propagated through the rest of the database via the defined relationships.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-are-different-normalization-forms">What are different Normalization Forms?<a class="hash-link" href="#what-are-different-normalization-forms" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><ul><li>1NF: Eliminate Repeating Groups Make a separate table for each set of related attributes, and give each table a primary key.

Stored procedures accept input parameters so that a single procedure can be used over the network by several clients using different input data. And when the procedure is modified, all clients automatically get the new version. Stored procedures reduce network traffic and improve performance. Stored procedures can be used to help ensure the integrity of the database.
e.g. sp_helpdb, sp_renamedb, sp_depends etc.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-is-trigger">What is Trigger?<a class="hash-link" href="#what-is-trigger" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>A trigger is an SQL procedure that initiates an action when an event (INSERT, DELETE or UPDATE) occurs. Triggers are stored in and managed by the DBMS. Triggers are used to maintain the referential integrity of data by changing the data in a systematic fashion. A trigger cannot be called or executed; the DBMS automatically fires the trigger as a result of a data modification to the associated table. Triggers can be viewed as similar to stored procedures in that both consist of procedural logic that is stored at the database level. Stored procedures, however, are not event-drive and are not attached to a specific table as triggers are. Stored procedures are explicitly executed by invoking a CALL to the procedure while triggers are implicitly executed. In addition, triggers can also execute stored procedures.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-is-view">What is View?<a class="hash-link" href="#what-is-view" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>A simple view can be thought of as a subset of a table.

It should also be noted that as data in the original table changes, so does data in the view, as views are the way to look at part of the original table. The results of using a view are not permanently stored in the database. The data accessed through a view is actually constructed using standard T-SQL select command and can come from one to many different base tables or even other views.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="advantages-of-dbms">Advantages of Dbms?<a class="hash-link" href="#advantages-of-dbms" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><ul><li>Redundancy is controlled.</li><li>Unauthorised access is restricted.</li><li>Providing multiple user interfaces.</li><li>Enforcing integrity constraints.</li><li>Providing backup and recovery.</li></ul><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="disadvantage-in-file-processing-system">Disadvantage in File Processing System?<a class="hash-link" href="#disadvantage-in-file-processing-system" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><ul><li>Data redundancy &amp; inconsistency.</li><li>Difficult in accessing data.</li><li>Data isolation.</li><li>Data integrity.</li><li>Concurrent access is not possible.</li><li>Security Problems.</li></ul><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="describe-three-levels-of-data-abstraction">Describe Three Levels of Data Abstraction?<a class="hash-link" href="#describe-three-levels-of-data-abstraction" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>There are three levels of abstraction:

In other words, The ability to modify the schema definition in one level should not affect the schema definition in the next higher level.
Two types of Data Independence:

Logical Data Independence: Modification in logical level should affect the view level.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-is-a-view-and-how-it-is-related-to-data-independence">What is a View and how it is related to Data Independence?<a class="hash-link" href="#what-is-a-view-and-how-it-is-related-to-data-independence" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>A view may be thought of as a virtual table, that is, a table that does not really exist in its own right but is instead derived from one or more underlying base table. In other words, there is no stored file that direct represents the view instead a definition of view is stored in data dictionary. Growth and restructuring of base tables is not reflected in views. Thus the view can insulate users from the effects of restructuring and growth in the database.

You might think of an RDBMS as an operating system (or set of subsystems), designed specifically for controlling data access; its primary functions are storing, retrieving, and securing data. An RDBMS maintains its own list of authorized users and their associated privileges; manages memory caches and paging; controls locking for concurrent resource usage; dispatches and schedules user requests; and manages space usage within its table-space structures.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="name-the-sub-systems-of-rdbms">Name the Sub systems of Rdbms?<a class="hash-link" href="#name-the-sub-systems-of-rdbms" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>I/O, Security, Language Processing, Process Control, Storage Management, Logging and Recovery, Distribution Control, Transaction Control, Memory Management, Lock Management.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-is-rowid">What is Rowid?<a class="hash-link" href="#what-is-rowid" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>The ROWID is a unique database-wide physical address for every row on every table.

The ROWID consists of the following three components, the combination of which uniquely identifies the physical storage location of the row.
Oracle database file number, which contains the block with the rows
Oracle block address, which contains the row
The row within the block (because each block can hold many rows)
The ROWID is used internally in indexes as a quick means of retrieving rows with a particular key value.
