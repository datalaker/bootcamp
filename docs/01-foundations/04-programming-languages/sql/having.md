# SQL HAVING

You'll often encounter datasets where GROUP BY isn't enough to get what you're looking for. Let's say that it's not enough just to know aggregated stats by month. After all, there are a lot of months in this dataset. Instead, you might want to find every month during which AAPL stock worked its way over $400/share. The WHERE clause won't work for this because it doesn't allow you to filter on aggregate columnsâ€”that's where the HAVING clause comes in.
