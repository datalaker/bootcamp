    "# How to Join a fact and a type 2 dimension (SCD2) table\n",
    "\n",
    "SCD2 stands for slowly changing dimension type 2. In this type, we create a new row for each change to an existing record in the corresponding transaction table. Each row in the SCD2 dimension table will have row effective and row expiration datetime columns to denote the range within which that row represents the state of the data.\n",

In our application table, this would mean that the record with user_id=b0cc9fde-a29a-498e-824f-e52399991beb now has a zip code of 10012.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the data warehouse, we need to ensure that we have access to historical data to run historical analyses. For example, if an end user want to check how many of our users lived in the zip code 10027 for the month of Dec 2020, we need to make sure that the user with user_id=b0cc9fde-a29a-498e-824f-e52399991beb is counted towards 10027 and not 10012, because that is where that user was, as of December 2020.\n",
