# SQL IS NULL

IS NULL is a logical operator in SQL that allows you to exclude rows with missing data from your results.

Some tables contain null valuesâ€”cells with no data in them at all. This can be confusing for heavy Excel users, because the difference between a cell having no data and a cell containing a space isn't meaningful in Excel. In SQL, the implications can be pretty serious.

You can select rows that contain no data in a given column by using IS NULL.
