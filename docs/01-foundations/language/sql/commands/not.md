# SQL NOT

NOT is a logical operator in SQL that you can put before any conditional statement to select rows for which that statement is false.

NOT is commonly used with LIKE.

NOT is also frequently used to identify non-null rows, but the syntax is somewhat specialâ€”you need to include IS beforehand.
