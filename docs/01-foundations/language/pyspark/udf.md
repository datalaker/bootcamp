# UDFs

In PySpark, `UDF` stands for User-Defined Function, which is a feature that allows users to define their own functions and apply them to Spark data frames or RDDs.

UDFs are useful when you need to apply a custom transformation to your data that is not available in Spark’s built-in functions. For example, you might want to apply a complex calculation or perform a text processing task that is not covered by Spark’s standard library.
