# S3

**Amazon S3** is one of the most commonly used cloud data storage services for web applications, and high-performance compute use cases. It is Amazon's object storage service providing virtually unlimited data storage. Some of the advantages of using Amazon S3 include very high scalability, durability, data availability, security, and performance. Amazon S3 can be used for a variety of cloud-native applications, ranging from simple data storage to very large data lakes to web hosting and high-performance applications, such as training very advanced and compute-intensive ML models. Amazon S3 offers several classes of storage options with differences in terms of data access, resiliency, archival needs, and cost. We can choose the storage class that best suits our use case and business needs. There is also an option for cost saving when the access pattern is unknown or changes over time (S3 Intelligent-Tiering).

#### Key capabilities and features of Amazon S3

In Amazon S3, data is stored as objects in *buckets*. An object is a file and any metadata that describes the file, and buckets are the resources (containers) for the objects. Some of the key capabilities of Amazon S3 are discussed next.

##### Data durability

Amazon S3 is designed to provide very high levels of durability to the data, up to 99.999999999%. This means that the chances of data objects stored in Amazon S3 getting lost are extremely low (average expected loss of approximately 0.000000001% of objects, or 1 out of 10,000 objects every 10 million years). For HPC applications, data durability is of the utmost importance. For example, for training an ML model, data scientists need to carry out various experiments on the same dataset in order to fine-tune the model parameters to get the best performance. If the data storage from which training and validation data is read is not durable for these experiments, then the results of the trained model will not be consistent and hence can lead to incorrect insights, as well as bad inference results. For this reason, Amazon S3 is used in many ML and other data-dependent HPC applications for storing very large amounts of data.

##### Object size

In Amazon S3, we can store objects up to 5 TB in size. This is especially useful for applications that require processing large files, such as videos (for example, high-definition movies or security footage), large logs, or other similar files. Many high-performance compute applications, such as training ML models for a video classification example, require processing thousands of such large files to come up with a model that makes inferences on unseen data well. A deep learning model can read these large files from Amazon S3 one (or more) at a time, store them temporarily on the model training virtual machine, compute and optimize model parameters, and then move on to the next object (file). This way, even machines with smaller disk space and memory can be used to train these computationally intensive models over large data files. Similarly, at the time of model inference, if there is a need to store the data, it can be stored in Amazon S3 for up to 5 TB of object size.

##### Storage classes

Amazon S3 has various storage classes. We can store data in any of these classes and can also move the data across the classes. The right storage class to pick for storing data depends on our data storage, cost, and retention needs. The different S3 storage classes are as follows:

- S3 Standard
- S3 Standard-Infrequent Access
- S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access
- S3 Intelligent-Tiering
- S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval
- S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval
- S3 Glacier Deep Archive
- S3 Outposts

##### Storage management

Amazon S3 also has various advanced storage management options, such as data replication, prevention of accidental deletion of data, and data version control. Data in Amazon S3 can be replicated into destination buckets in the same or different AWS Regions. This can be done to add redundancy and hence reliability and also improve performance and latency. This is quite important for HPC applications as well since real-time HPC applications that need access to data stored in Amazon S3 will benefit from accessing data from a geographically closer AWS Region. Performance is generally accelerated by up to 60% when datasets are replicated across multiple AWS Regions. Amazon S3 also supports batch operations for data access, enabling various S3 operations to be carried out on billions of objects with a single API call. In addition, lifecycle policies can be configured for objects stored in Amazon S3. Using these policies, S3 objects can be moved automatically to different storage classes depending on access need, resulting in cost optimization.

##### Storage monitoring

Amazon S3 also has several monitoring capabilities. For example, tags can be assigned to S3 buckets, and AWS cost allocation reports can be used to view aggregated usage and cost using these tags. Amazon CloudWatch can also be used to view the health of S3 buckets. In addition, bucket- and object-level activities can also be tracked using AWS CloudTrail.

The preceding figure shows that we can also configure Amazon **Simple Notification Service** (**SNS**) to trigger AWS Lambda to carry out various tasks in the case of certain events, such as new file uploads and so on.

##### Data transfer

For any application built upon large amounts of data and using S3, the data first needs to be transferred to S3. There are various services provided by AWS that work with S3 for different data transfer needs, including hybrid (premises/cloud) storage and online and offline data transfer. For example, if we want to extend our on-premise storage with cloud AWS storage, we can use **AWS Storage Gateway**. Some of the commonly implemented use cases for AWS Storage Gateway are the replacement of tape libraries, cloud storage backend file shares, and low-latency caching of data for on-premise applications.

![Data transfer example using AWS Storage Gateway](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62965911/214261360-cf2084ac-c47e-43e9-b5b6-87842da49a96.png)

For use cases requiring online data transfer, AWS DataSync can be used to efficiently transfer hundreds of terabytes into Amazon S3. In addition, AWS Transfer Family can also be used to transfer data to S3 using SFTP, FTPS, and FTP. For offline data transfer use cases, AWS Snow Family has a few options available, including AWS Snowcone, AWS Snowball, and AWS Snowmobile.

##### Performance

One big advantage of S3 for HPC applications is that it supports parallel requests. Each S3 prefix supports 3,500 requests per second to add data and 5,500 requests per second to retrieve data. Prefixes are used to organize data in S3 buckets. These are a sequence of characters at the beginning of an object's key name. We can have as many prefixes as we need in parallel, and each prefix will support this throughput. This way, we can achieve the desired throughput for our application by adding prefixes. In addition, if there is a long geographic separation between the client and the S3 bucket, we can use Amazon S3 Transfer Acceleration to transfer data. Amazon CloudFront is a globally distributed network of edge locations.

Using S3 Transfer Allocation, data is first transferred to an edge location in Amazon CloudFront. From the edge location, an optimized high-bandwidth and low-latency network path is then used to transfer the data to the S3 bucket. Furthermore, data can also be cached in CloudFront edge locations for frequently accessed requests, further optimizing performance. These performance-related features help in improving throughput and reducing latency for data access, especially suited to various HPC applications.

##### Consistency

Data storage requests to Amazon S3 have strong read-after-write consistency. This means that any data written (new or an overwrite) to S3 is available immediately.

##### Analytics

Amazon S3 also has analytics capabilities, including S3 Storage Lens and S3 Storage Class Analysis. S3 Storage Lens can be used to improve storage cost efficiency, as well as to provide best practices for data protection. In addition, it can be used to look into object storage usage and activity trends. It can provide a single view across thousands of accounts in an organization and can generate insights on various levels, such as account, bucket, and prefix. Using S3 Storage Class, we can optimize cost by deciding on when to move data to the right storage class. This information can be used to configure the lifecycle policy to make the data transfer for the S3 bucket. Amazon S3 Inventory is another S3 feature that generates daily or weekly reports, including bucket names, key names, last modification dates, object size, class, replication, encryption status, and a few additional properties.

##### Data security

Amazon S3 has various security measures and features. These features include blocking unauthorized users from accessing data, locking objects to prevent deletions, modifying object ownership for access control, identity and access management, discovery and protection of sensitive data, server-side and client-side encryption, the inspection of an AWS environment, and connection to S3 from on-premise or in the cloud using private IP addresses.

#### Tiered storage for cost optimization: Amazon S3 storage classes

AWS provides options for configuring its data storage services with various different tiers of storage types. This significantly helps with optimizing cost and performance depending on the use case requirements. In this section, we will discuss the tiered storage options for Amazon.

##### Amazon S3 Standard

Amazon S3 Standard is the general-purpose S3 object storage commonly used for frequently accessed data. It provides high throughput and low latency. Some of the common applications of S3 Standard are online gaming, big data analytics, ML model training and data storage, an offline feature store for ML applications, content storage, and distribution, and websites with dynamic content.

##### Amazon S3 Intelligent-Tiering

**Amazon S3 Intelligent-Tiering** is the storage class for unknown, unpredictable, and changing access patterns. There are three access tiers in S3 Intelligent-Tiering -- frequent, infrequent, and archive tiers. S3 Intelligent-Tiering monitors access patterns and moves data to the appropriate tiers accordingly in order to save costs without impacting performance, retrieval fees, or creating operational overhead. In addition, we can also set up S3 Intelligent-Tiering to move data to the Deep Archive Access tier for data that is accessed very rarely (180 days or more). This can result in further additional cost savings.

##### Amazon S3 Standard-Infrequent Access

**Amazon S3 Standard-Infrequent Access** is for use cases where data is generally accessed less frequently, but rapid access may be required. It offers a low per GB storage price and retrieval charge but the same performance and durability as S3 Standard. Some of the common use cases for this tier are backups, a data store for disaster recovery, and long-term storage. For high-performance compute applications, such as ML, this storage tier can be used to store historical data on which models have already been trained or analytics have already been carried out and is not needed for model retraining for a while.

##### Amazon S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access

**Amazon S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access** is very similar to Amazon S3 Standard-Infrequent Access, but the data is stored in only one AZ (multiple devices) instead of the default three AZs within the same AWS Region as for other S3 storage classes. This is even more cost-effective than the S3 Standard-Infrequent Access storage class and is commonly used for storing secondary backups or easily re-creatable data, for example, engineered features no longer used for active ML model training.

##### Amazon S3 Glacier

**Amazon S3 Glacier** storage classes are highly flexible, low-cost, and high-performance data archival storage classes. In Amazon S3 Glacier, there are three storage classes. Amazon S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval is generally used where data is accessed very rarely, but the retrieval is required with latency in milliseconds, for example, news media assets and genomics data. Amazon S3 Flexible Retrieval is for use cases where large datasets such as backup recovery data need to be retrieved at no additional cost, but instant retrieval is not a requirement. The usual retrieval times for such use cases are a few minutes to a few hours. Amazon S3 Glacier Deep Archive is for use cases that require very infrequent retrieval, such as preserved digital media and compliance archives, for example. It is the lowest-cost storage of all the options discussed previously, and the typical retrieval time is 12 hours to 2 days.

##### S3 on Outposts

For on-premise AWS Outposts environments, object storage can be configured using **Amazon S3 on Outposts**. It stores data reliably and redundantly across multiple devices and servers on AWS Outposts, especially suited for use cases with local data residency requirements.
