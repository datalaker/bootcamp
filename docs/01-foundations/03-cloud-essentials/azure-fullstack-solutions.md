#### Modern Azure Data Architecture Platform

While Microsoft Azure has a vast collection of resources, the most common components within the Modern Enterprise Data and Analytics Platform are listed in following figure. As an Azure Data Engineer, it will be critical to be able to design and implement an end-to-end solution that follows this architectural process or custom variations of it while accounting for security, high availability, and more. It will also be critical to understand the differences and similarities between multiple data storage and data integration options.

#### High-level diagram of Azure data architecture with DevOps CI/CD

With free online video tutorials, along with Microsoft’s vast knowledge base of documentation that’s easily accessible, understanding the end-to-end architectural process and how it relates to connectivity, security, infrastructure as code, Azure administration, DevOps CI/CD, and billing and cost management will instill confidence in your holistic understanding of Azure as you help your organization and team evangelize Azure Data Engineering and pioneer their journey into the cloud. Figure below presents a diagram with multiple components, along with how it all ties together from an architectural standpoint.

#### Data Platform Architecture

Data is ingested into the system and persisted in a storage layer. Processing aggregates and reshapes the data to enable analytics and machine learning scenarios. Orchestration and governance are cross-cutting concerns that cover all the components of the platform. Once processed, data is distributed to other downstream systems. All components are tracked by and deployed from source control.
