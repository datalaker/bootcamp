### Image Similarity

Image similarity is the measure of how similar two images are. In other words, it quantifies the degree of similarity between intensity patterns in two images.

- **Applications:** Duplicate product detection, image clustering, visual search, product recommendations.
- **Scope:** Fine-tuning on classes for greater accuracy
- **Tools:** TFHub

#### Models

- *[DeepRank: A New Deep Architecture for Relevance Ranking in Information Retrieval. arXiv, 2017.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.05649)*
- ConvNets: Pre-trained models like MobileNet, EfficientNet, BiT-L/BiT-M can be used to convert images into vectors. These models can be found on TFHub. For more accuracy, fine-tuning can be done.
- FAISS: *[Billion-scale similarity search with GPUs. arXiv, 2017.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.08734)* - Faiss is a library for efficient similarity search and clustering of dense vectors.
- Siamese Network: Siamese network is a neural network that contains two or more identical subnetwork. The purpose of this network is to find the similarity or comparing the relationship between two comparable things. Unlike the classification task that uses cross-entropy as the loss function, the siamese network usually uses contrastive loss or triplet loss.
- Similarity Measures: L1 (Manhattan distance), L2 (Euclidean distance), Hinge Loss for Triplets.

#### Process flow

- Step 1: Collect Images - Download the raw image dataset into a directory. Categorize these images into their respective category directories. Make sure that images are of the same type, JPEG recommended. We will also process the metadata and store it in a serialized file, CSV recommended.
- Step 2: Encoder Fine-tuning - Download the pre-trained image model and add two additional layers on top of that: the first layer is a feature vector layer and the second layer is the classification layer. We will only train these 2 layers on our data and after training, we will select the feature vector layer as the output of our fine-tuned encoder. After fine-tuning the model, we will save the feature extractor for later use.
- Step 3: Image Vectorization - Now, we will use the encoder (prepared in step 2) to encode the images (prepared in step 1). We will save the feature vector of each image as an array in a directory. After processing, we will save these embeddings for later use.
- Step 4: Metadata and Indexing - We will assign a unique id to each image and create dictionaries to locate information of this image: 1) Image id to Image name dictionary, 2) Image id to image feature vector dictionary, and 3) (optional) Image id to metadata product id dictionary. We will also create an image id to image feature vector indexing. Then we will save these dictionaries and index objects for later use.
- Step 5: UAT Testing - Wrap the model inference engine in API for client testing. We will receive an image from user, encode it with our image encoder, find Top-K similar vectors using Indexing object, and retrieve the image (and metadata) using dictionaries. We send these images (and metadata) back to the user.
- Step 6: Deployment - Deploy the model on cloud or edge as per the requirement.
- Step 7: Documentation - Prepare the documentation and transfer all assets to the client.

#### Use Cases

### Pose Estimation

Pose estimation is a computer vision task that infers the pose of a person or object in an image or video. This is typically done by identifying, locating, and tracking the number of key points on a given object or person. For objects, this could be corners or other significant features. And for humans, these key points represent major joints like an elbow or knee.

![content-concepts-raw-computer-vision-pose-estimation-img](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62965911/216822795-bdcc650d-08c1-4e8a-9b67-f3a8a0aba2a5.png)

- Step 3: Data Preparation - Setup the database connection and fetch the data into the environment. Explore the data, validate it, and create a preprocessing strategy. Clean the data and make it ready for modeling

### Scene Text Recognition

Text—as a fundamental tool of communicating information—scatters throughout natural scenes, e.g., street signs, product labels, license plates, etc. Automatically reading text in natural scene images is an important task in machine learning and gains increasing attention due to a variety of applications. For example, accessing text in images can help the visually impaired understand the surrounding environment. To enable autonomous driving, one must accurately detect and recognize every road sign. Indexing text in images would enable image search and retrieval from billions of consumer photos on the internet.

- Step 3: Model Building - Apply different kinds of detection, recognition and single-shot models on the images. Track the progress and experiments. Validate the final set of models and select/assemble the final model.
- Step 4: UAT Testing - Wrap the model inference engine in API for client testing
- Step 5: Deployment - Deploy the model on cloud or edge as per the requirement
- Step 6: Documentation - Prepare the documentation and transfer all assets to the client

### Video Action Recognition

This is the task of identifying human activities/actions (e.g. eating, playing) in videos. In other words, this task classifies segments of videos into a set of pre-defined categories.

- **Applications:** Automated surveillance, elderly behavior monitoring, human-computer interaction, content-based video retrieval, and video summarization.
- **Scope:** Human Action only
- **Tools:** OpenCV

#### **Models**

- **3D-ResNet**: **[Can Spatiotemporal 3D CNNs Retrace the History of 2D CNNs and ImageNet?](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.09577)** - the authors explore how existing state-of-the-art 2D architectures (such as ResNet, ResNeXt, DenseNet, etc.) can be extended to video classification via 3D kernels.
- **R(2+1)D**: This model was pre-trained on 65 million social media videos and fine-tuned on Kinetics400.

#### Process flow

- Step 1: Collect videos - Capture via camera, scrap from the internet or use public datasets
- Step 2: Create Labels - Use open-source tools like VGA Video Annotator for video annotation
- Step 3: Data Acquisition - Setup the database connection and fetch the data into python environment
- Step 4: Data Exploration - Explore the data, validate it and create preprocessing strategy
- Step 5: Data Preparation - Clean the data and make it ready for modeling
- Step 6: Model Building - Create the model architecture in python and perform a sanity check
- Step 7: Model Training - Start the training process and track the progress and experiments
- Step 8: Model Validation - Validate the final set of models and select/assemble the final model
- Step 9: UAT Testing - Wrap the model inference engine in API for client testing
- Step 10: Deployment - Deploy the model on cloud or edge as per the requirement
- Step 11: Documentation - Prepare the documentation and transfer all assets to the client
