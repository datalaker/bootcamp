# Amazon Sagemaker

Amazon SageMaker helps data scientists and developers to prepare, build, train, and deploy machine learning models quickly by bringing together a broad set of purpose-built capabilities. In this demo, learn about how SageMaker can accelerate machine learning development by way of an example where we build the perfect musical playlist tailored to a user's tastes.

## Lab: End-to-end workflow for auto claims fraud detection using Amazon SageMaker

The purpose of this end-to-end example is to demonstrate how to prepare, train, and deploy a model that detects auto insurance claims.

"Auto insurance fraud ranges from misrepresenting facts on insurance applications and inflating insurance claims to staging accidents and submitting claim forms for injuries or damage that never occurred, to false reports of stolen vehicles. Fraud accounted for between 15 percent and 17 percent of total claims payments for auto insurance bodily injury in 2012, according to an Insurance Research Council (IRC) study. The study estimated that between $5.6 billion and $7.7 billion was fraudulently added to paid claims for auto insurance bodily injury payments in 2012, compared with a range of $4.3 billion to $5.8 billion in 2002. " source: Insurance Information Institute

In this example, we will use an auto insurance domain to detect claims that are possibly fraudulent. more precisely we address the use-case: "what is the likelihood that a given auto claim is fraudulent?" , and explore the technical solution.

## Lab: Customer Churn Prediction with XGBoost

Using Gradient Boosted Trees to Predict Mobile Customer Departure

Losing customers is costly for any business. Identifying unhappy customers early on gives you a chance to offer them incentives to stay. This notebook describes using machine learning (ML) for the automated identification of unhappy customers, also known as customer churn prediction. ML models rarely give perfect predictions though, so this notebook is also about how to incorporate the relative costs of prediction mistakes when determining the financial outcome of using ML.

We use a familiar example of churn: leaving a mobile phone operator. Seems like one can always find fault with their provider du jour! And if the provider knows that a customer is thinking of leaving, it can offer timely incentives - such as a phone upgrade or perhaps having a new feature activated â€“ and the customer may stick around. Incentives are often much more cost-effective than losing and reacquiring a customer.
