# Snowflake dbt cloud TPCH

> Accelerating Data Teams with Snowflake and dbt Cloud Hands On Lab

In this lab we'll be transforming raw retail data into a consumable orders model that's ready for visualization. We'll be utilizing the TPC-H dataset that comes out of the box with your Snowflake account and transform it using some of dbt's most powerful features. By the time we're done you'll have a fully functional dbt project with testing and documentation, dedicated development and production environments, and experience with the dbt git workflow.
