# SQL vs NoSQL

As you design large systems ( or even smaller ones), you need to decide the inflow-processing and outflow of data coming- and getting processed in the system.

Data is generally organized in tables as rows and columns where columns represents attributes and rows represent records and keys have logical relationships. The SQL db schema always shows relational, tabular data following the ACID properties.

SQL databases have predefined schema and the data is organized/displayed in the form of tables. These databases use SQL ( Structured Query Language) to define, manipulate, update the data.

Relational databases like MS SQL Server, PostgreSQL, Sybase, MySQL Database, Oracle, etc. use SQL.

NoSQL databases on the other side, have no predefined schema which adds to more flexibility to use the formats that best suits the data - Work with graphs, column-oriented data, key-value and documents etc. They are generally preferred for hierarchical data, graphs ( e.g. social network) and to work with large data.

Some examples - Wide-column use Cassandra and HBase, Graph use Neo4j, Document use MongoDB and CouchDB, Key-value use Redis and DynamoDB.

| Definition                 | SQL databases are primarily called RDBMSs or relational databases.                                                              | NoSQL databases are primarily called as non-relational or distributed databases.                                                                                                             |
| Designed for               | Traditional RDBMS uses SQL syntax and queries to analyze and get the data for further insights. They are used for OLAP systems. | NoSQL database system consists of various kinds of database technologies. These databases were developed in response to the demands presented for the development of the modern application. |
| Query language             | Structured Query Language (SQL)                                                                                                 | No declarative query language                                                                                                                                                                |
| Type                       | SQL databases are table-based databases.                                                                                        | NoSQL databases can be document-based, key-value pair, graph databases.                                                                                                                      |
| Schema                     | SQL databases have a predefined schema.                                                                                         | NoSQL databases use a dynamic schema for unstructured data.                                                                                                                                  |
| Ability to scale           | SQL databases are vertically scalable.                                                                                          | NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable.                                                                                                                                                   |
| Examples                   | Oracle, Postgres, and MS SQL.                                                                                                   | MongoDB, Redis, Neo4j, Cassandra, HBase.                                                                                                                                                     |
| Best suited for            | An ideal choice for the complex query-intensive environment.                                                                    | It is not a good fit for complex queries.                                                                                                                                                    |
| Hierarchical data storage | SQL databases are not suitable for hierarchical data storage.                                                                   | More suitable for the hierarchical data store as it supports key-value pair methods.                                                                                                         |
| Variations                 | One type with minor variations.                                                                                                 | Many different types that include key-value stores, document databases, and graph databases.                                                                                                 |
| Development year           | It was developed in the 1970s to deal with issues with flat file storage.                                                       | Developed in the late 2000s to overcome issues and limitations of SQL databases.                                                                                                             |
| Consistency                | It should be configured for strong consistency.                                                                                 | It depends on DBMS as some offer strong consistency like MongoDB, whereas others offer only eventual consistency, like Cassandra.                                                            |
| Best used for              | RDBMS is the right option for solving ACID problems.                                                                            | NoSQL is best used for solving data availability problems.                                                                                                                                   |
| Importance                 | It should be used when data validity is super important.                                                                        | Use when it’s more important to have fast data than correct data.                                                                                                                           |
| Best option                | When you need to support dynamic queries.                                                                                       | Use when you need to scale based on changing requirements.                                                                                                                                   |
| ACID vs. BASE model       | ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability) is a standard for RDBMS.                                               | BASE (Basically Available, Soft state, Eventually consistent) is a model of many NoSQL systems.                                                                                              |
