# Installing Spark

To get started with PySpark, you will need to have the Spark software installed on your machine. You can download the latest version of Spark from the Apache Spark website. Once you have Spark installed, you can start using it to process data.

One of the most common ways to use Spark is through the PySpark library, which allows you to use Python to interact with Spark. The following code snippet shows how to create a SparkSession and read it in a CSV file:

```py
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession

# Create a SparkSession
spark = SparkSession.builder.appName("MyApp").getOrCreate()

# Read in a CSV file
df = spark.read.csv("path/to/file.csv", header=True, inferSchema=True)# Create a SparkSession
spark = SparkSession.builder.appName("MyApp").getOrCreate()
```

In this example, we are creating a SparkSession and setting the appName to “MyApp”. We then use the read.csv() function to read in a CSV file and store it in a DataFrame. The header and inferSchema options are set to True, which tells Spark to use the first row of the CSV file as the header and to infer the schema of the data.
