# SQL LIMIT

As you might expect, the limit restricts how many rows the SQL query returns.

**Why should you limit your results?**

Many analysts use limits as a simple way to keep their queries from taking too long to return. The aim of many of your queries will simply be to see what a particular table looks likeâ€”you'll want to scan the first few rows of data to get an idea of which fields you care about and how you want to manipulate them. If you query a very large table (such as one with hundreds of thousands or millions of rows) and don't use a limit, you could end up waiting a long time for all of your results to be displayed, which doesn't make sense if you only care about the first few.
