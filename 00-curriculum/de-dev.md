* [ ] Building End to end data pipeline in AWS - Activity 1: Ingestion with DMS, Activity 2: Data Lake Hydration, Activity 3: DMS Migration, Activity 4: Transforming data with Glue - Data Validation and ETL, Activity 5: Query and Visualize [[source code](../12-capstones/cloudmaze)]
* [ ] Funflix - You are working as a data engineer in an Australian media company Funflix. You got the following requirements and tasks to solve. 1 - Design the data warehouse for Funflix. 2 - Build and deploy the data pipeline for Funflix's multi-region business. 3 - Build a data lake [[source code](../12-capstones/funflix)]
* [ ] Datalake Schema Correction (AWS S3, Glue, Athena) [[source code](../12-capstones/hmc)]
* [ ] Kortex - In this Capstone project, you will: 1. Design a data platform that uses MySQL as an OLTP database and MongoDB as a NoSQL database. 2. Design and implement a data warehouse and generate reports from the data. 3. Design a reporting dashboard that reflects the key metrics of the business. 4. Extract data from OLTP, and NoSQL databases, transform it and load it into the data warehouse, and then create an ETL pipeline. 5. And finally, create a Spark connection to the data warehouse, and then deploy a machine learning model [[source code](../12-capstones/kortex)]
* [ ] Movie Review Sentiment Analysis Pipeline - Build a pipeline that expresses the fact artist review sentiment and film review sentiment, based on the data provided by IMDb and TMDb [[source code](../12-capstones/movie-sentiment)]
* [ ] Building Recommender System from Scratch - In this capstone, you will build 1. Front-end website built with Plotly Dash. 2. Clickstream data collection using Divolte pipeline. 3. Model building in python. 4. Recommendation Serving [[source code](../12-capstones/recofront)]
* [ ] Reddit Submissions, Authors and Subreddits analysis - This project will use a sample of publicly available dump of Reddit and load it into a AWS Redshift warehouse so that Data Scientists can make use of the content and for example develop a recommender system that finds the most suitable subreddit for your purposes. The goal of this project is to create a Data Warehouse to analyze trending and new subreddits using Airflow. The project uses the Reddit API to get subreddits and stores them on AWS S3 in JSON format. Data processing happens on an EMR cluster on AWS using PySpark and processed data gets stored on AWS S3 in parquet format. Finally, the data gets inserted into AWS Redshift, gets denormalized to create fact and dimension tables [[source code](../12-capstones/reddit)]
* [ ] Data Pipeline with dbt, Airflow and Great Expectations - In this project, we will learn how to combine the functions of three open source tools - Airflow, dbt and Great expectations - to build, test, validate, document, and orchestrate an entire pipeline, end to end, from scratch. We are going to load the NYC Taxi data into Redshift warehouse and then transform and validate the data using dbt and great expectations. By the end of this project, you’ll understand- The basics of dbt, Airflow, and Great Expectations - How to effectively combine these components to build a robust data pipeline - When and how to implement data validation using these tools - How to start developing a data quality strategy for your organization that goes beyond implementing data validation. And you’ll be able to - Write and run Airflow, dbt, and Great Expectations code - Design and implement a robust data pipeline - Implement data validation and alerting across a data pipeline [[source code](../12-capstones/robust-data-pipeline)]
* [ ] Sparkify - In this capstone, you will build 1. SQL Data Modeling with Postgres, 2. NoSQL Data Modeling with Cassandra, 3. Data Lake with AWS and PySpark, 4. Data Warehouse with Redshift, 5. Data Pipeline with Airflow [[source code](../12-capstones/spectrum)]
