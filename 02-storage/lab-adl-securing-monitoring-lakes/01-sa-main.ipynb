This lab will focus on configuring security controls such as firewalls, encryption, and creating private links to a Data Lake account. By the end of this lab, you will have learned how to configure a firewall, virtual network, and private link to secure the Data Lake, encrypt Data Lake using Azure Key Vault, and monitor key user actions in Data Lake.\n",

    "1. Log in to portal.azure.com, click on Create a resource, search for Key Vault, and click on Create. Provide the key vault details, Click on Review + Create\n",

    "1. Provide a name for the key to be used for encryption of the storage account. The default option, Generate, ensures that the key is generated automatically. Click on Create\n",
    "1. Once the key is created, the screen automatically moves to the key vault selection page in the Blob storage, and the newly created key is selected as the key. Click on Select\n",

    "\n",
    "The Data Lake account automatically gets permissions on the key vault to extract the key and perform encryption on data.

In this recipe, we'll create an alert to send an email if the used capacity metrics for an Azure storage account exceed 5 MB. The used capacity threshold of 5 MB is not a standard and is deliberately kept low to explain the alert functionality.\n",

    "1. On the storage account page, search for alert and open Alerts in the Monitoring section\n",
    "1. On the Alerts page, click on + New alert rule:\n",

    "1. On the Configure signal logic page, select Used capacity under Signal name\n",
    "1. On the Configure signal logic page, under Alert logic, set Operator to Greater than, Aggregation type to Average, and configure the threshold to 5 MiB. We need to provide the value in bytes\n",
    "1. Click Done to configure the trigger. The condition is added, and we'll be taken back to the Create alert rule page\n",
    "1. The next step is to add an action to perform when the alert condition is reached. On the Create alert rule page, in the ACTIONS GROUPS section, click Create\n",
    "1. On the Add action group page, provide the Action group name, Display name, and Resource group details\n",
    "1. In Notifications, provide an email address. Click on Review + Create\n",
    "1. Click on Create to create the action group. We are then taken back to the Create rule page. The Email action is listed in the Action Groups section.\n",
    "1. The next step is to define the Severity, Alert rule name, and Alert rule description details\n",
    "1. Click the Create alert rule button to create the alert.\n",
    "1. The next step is to trigger the alert. To do that, download BigFile.csv from the data folder to the Azure storage account. The triggered alerts are listed on the Alerts page.\n",
    "1. An email is sent to the email ID specified in the email action group.\n",
    "\n",
    "How it works…\n",

    "Setting up an alert is easy. At first, we need to define the alert condition (a trigger or signal). An alert condition defines the metrics and threshold that, when breached, trigger the alert. We can define more than one condition on multiple metrics for one alert.\n",
    "\n",
    "We then need to define the action to be performed when the alert condition is reached. We can define more than one action for an alert. In our example, in addition to sending an email when the used capacity is more than 5 MB, we can configure Azure Automation to delete the old blobs/files in order to maintain the Azure storage capacity within 5 MB.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are other signals, such as transactions, ingress, egress, availability, Success Server Latency, and Success E2E Latency, on which alerts can be defined.
