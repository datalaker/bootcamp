# The data science origin story

There's a saying in the data science community that's been around for a while, and it goes: "*A data scientist is better than any computer scientist at statistics, and better than any statistician at computer programming*." This encapsulates the general skills of most data scientists, as well as the history of the field.

Data science combines computer programming with statistics, and some even call data science applied statistics. Conversely, some statisticians think data science is *only* statistics. So, while we might say data science dates back to the roots of statistics in the 19th century, the roots of modern data science actually begin around the year 2000. At this time, the internet was beginning to bloom, and with it, the advent of big data. The amount of data generated from the web resulted in the new field of data science being born.

A brief timeline of key historical data science events is as follows:

- **1962**: John Tukey writes *The Future of Data Analysis*, where he envisions a new field for learning insights from data
- **1977**: Tukey publishes the book *Exploratory Data Analysis*, which is a key part of data science today
- **1991**: Guido Van Rossum publishes the Python programming language online for the first time, which goes on to become the top data science language used at the time of writing
- **1993**: The R programming language is publicly released, which goes on to become the second most-used data science general-purpose language
- **1996**: The International Federation of Classification Societies holds a conference titled "*Data Science, Classification and Related Methods*" – possibly the first time "data science" was used to refer to something similar to modern data science
- **1997**: Jeff Wu proposes renaming statistics "data science" in an inauguration lecture at the University of Michigan
- **2001**: William Cleveland publishes a paper describing a new field, "data science," which expands on data analysis
- **2008**: Jeff Hammerbacher and DJ Patil use the term "data scientist" in job postings after trying to come up with a good job title for their work
- **2010**: Kaggle.com launches as an online data science community and data science competition website
- **2010s**: Universities begin offering masters and bachelor's degrees in data science; data science job postings explode to new heights year after year; big breakthroughs are made in deep learning; the number of data science software libraries and publications burgeons.
- **2012**: Harvard Business Review publishes the notorious article entitled *Data Scientist: The Sexiest Job of the 21st Century*, which adds fuel to the data science fire.
- **2015**: DJ Patil becomes the chief data scientist of the US for two years.
- **2015**: TensorFlow (a deep learning and machine learning library) is released.
- **2018**: Google releases cloud AutoML, democratizing a new automatic technique for machine learning and data science.
- **2020**: Amazon SageMaker Studio is released, which is a cloud tool for building, training, deploying, and analyzing machine learning models.
